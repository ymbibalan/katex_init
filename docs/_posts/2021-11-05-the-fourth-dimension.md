I just finished reading William A. Granville's
[_The Fourth Dimension and the Bible_](https://archive.org/details/fourthdimensionb00gran/) (1922).
It's quite mind-bending! I don't mean the Biblical stuff (which is all quite a stretch),
but specifically Granville's mathematical examples, several of which were completely new to me.

Any reader of [_Flatland_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) (Edwin Abbott, 1884) knows the
basics:

- How a cube passing through a plane casts "cross-sections" that may be squares, triangles, or hexagons depending on its angle.

- How a Flatlander's eye receives impressions in only one dimension.

- How a Linelander keeps the same two neighbors for life, being unable to pass either of them.

- How the three-dimensional cross-section of a fourth-dimensional being could appear within
    a locked room, or touch a point on the interior of a three-dimensional object without
    puncturing or intersecting the object's surface.

A fourth-dimensional being could also undo a knot in a three-dimensional rope, bringing one
portion of the rope past another portion — not "through" but "past" — by means of lifting
that portion temporarily into the fourth dimension. Page 50:

> Our knots would therefore be useless in four-dimensional space. Evidently our chains would
> also be useless because the links in them could be separated without breaking.
>
> Corresponding to this in Flatland would be a cord fastened at $$A$$ and $$B$$ and making
> a loop around, say, $$C$$.

I'd never particularly considered this idea of Flatland knots, or the impossibility
of unlooping the cord from around $$C$$. It makes me strangely anxious.

A few pages further on, Chapter 6 discusses "Rotation of Symmetric Configurations."

Granville lifts the analogy from one dimension to two dimensions:

> thru three-dimensional space until it coincides with the other.

And thence into three dimensions:

When we rotate the triangle $$ABC$$ through the third dimension,
no part of the triangle remains in Flatland; yet we can picture the
two-dimensional triangular "shadow" that would be cast into Flatland by a light
above and perpendicular to Flatland's plane. (It may help to imagine a
colored shadow, such that the points of the triangle further from
the plane cast redder shadows, and the closer points cast bluer shadows.)
Notice that halfway through $$ABC$$'s rotation, when the triangle's
own plane is perpendicular to Flatland's, the triangle's shadow
is momentarily reduced to a one-dimensional line (collinear with
the line of symmetry $$XY$$).

When we rotate the tetrahedron $$ABCD$$ through the fourth dimension,
no part of the tetrahedron remains in Spaceland; yet we can picture the
tetrahedral "shadow" that would be cast into Spaceland by a
light beyond and perpendicular to Spaceland's space. Halfway through
$$ABCD$$'s rotation, when the tetrahedron's own space is perpendicular
to Spaceland's, the tetrahedron's shadow would be momentarily reduced
to a two-dimensional triangle (coplanar with the plane of symmetry $$XY$$).

During the most recent [Celebration of Mind](/blog/2021/10/16/com-lineup/),
I happened across a neat ["Flatland Simulator"](https://github.com/zfletch/flatland-js)
written in JavaScript by Zachary Fletcher. The idea is to show what A. Square
would see, in a real Flatland environment.
[Play it here!](https://zfletch.github.io/flatland-js/)

This particular simulation, in true Flatlander style, omits any depiction of
Women or the Lower Classes; and its Regular Polygons swoop around rotating
in a frankly vulgar fashion. The grayscale is also a bit low-contrast for my eyes;
it would be fun to add a toggle demonstrating the visual impact of Chromatism.
Finally, I wish it were possible to toggle off the two-dimensional "spoiler" diagram
below the one-dimensional visualization. I've forked the repo with the intent of
modifying Fletcher's (GPL'ed) code; maybe one of these days I'll get around to it.

From Joris-Karl Huysmans' [_À rebours_](http://www.huysmans.org/against/agxiii.htm) (1884),
which I highly recommend to anyone with a decadent literary bent.
Our protagonist is briefly moved to philosophize on the slings and arrows:

> Presently, above the hedge separating the garden which lay at a lower level
> from the raised roadway leading up to the Fort, [Des Esseintes] caught sight of a band of
> young rascals tumbling over each other in the blazing sunshine. [...]
> Kicks and fisticuffs were freely exchanged, and the weaker vessels
> got tumbled over in the road, where they lay squalling as the jagged stones
> scraped their backsides.
>
> Looking on at the fury of these naughty youngsters, he reflected
> on the cruel and abominable law of the struggle for existence, and ignoble
> as the children were, he could not help sympathizing with their lot
> and concluding it would have been better for them had their mother
> never borne them.
>
> What madness to beget children! reflected Des Esseintes. And to think that
> ecclesiastics, who have taken a vow of sterility, have actually pushed unreason
> so far as to canonize [St. Vincent de Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul)
> because he saved innocent little ones for useless torments!
>
> Thanks to his odious precautions, he had postponed for years the death of beings,
> devoid of intelligence and feeling, in such wise that, having in time grown almost
> understanding and at any rate capable of pain, they could foresee the future,
> could expect and dread the death they had hitherto not known so much as the name of;
> that they could, some of them, even call upon it to come, in very hatred of the
> condemnation to live he inflicted on them by virtue of an illogical code of Theology.
>
> Yes, and since the old Saint’s death, his ideas had come to govern the world;
> children abandoned to die were rescued, instead of being left to perish quietly
> without their being conscious of aught amiss; while, at the same time, the life
> for which they were preserved was growing day by day harsher and more barren!
> Under a pretext of liberty and progress, Society had discovered yet another means
> of aggravating the miseries of man’s existence, by dragging him from his home,
> tricking him out in an absurd costume, putting specially contrived weapons in his hands,
> brutalizing him in a slavery identical with that from which they had, out of compassion,
> enfranchised the negro — and all this merely to put him in a condition to slaughter
> his neighbor without risking the scaffold, as do common murderers who work alone,
> without uniform, with arms less noisy and less swift.
>
> What a singular epoch, Des Esseintes told himself, is this, which, while invoking
> the sacred name of humanity, and striving to perfect anaesthetics to abolish physical pain,
> at the very same time provides such irritants to aggravate moral agonies!
>
> Ah! if ever, in the name of pity, useless procreation should be abolished,
> that time was now! But here, again, the laws promulgated by men like
> [Portalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Étienne-Marie_Portalis) and
> [Homais](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Homais)
> appeared, ferocious and self-contradictory.
>
> Justice deemed quite natural the ways men use to trick Nature in the marriage bed;
> it was a recognized, admitted fact; there was never a household, no matter how well-to-do,
> that did not employ means to hinder procreation, use contrivances to be bought openly
> in the shops — all artifices it would never occur to anybody to disapprove. Yet, if these means,
> these subterfuges proved ineffectual — if the trickery failed, and to make good the failure,
> recourse was had to more certain methods — there were not prisons and gaols and
> penal settlements enough to hold in _durance vile_ people condemned to this punishment
> by judge and jury, who the same night in the conjugal bed used every trickery they could
> devise not to beget youngsters of their own.
>
> The trickery itself therefore was no crime, but to repair its failure was one.
>
> In a word, Society regarded as a crime the act that consisted in killing a creature
> endowed with life; and yet, in expelling a foetus, one surely destroyed an animal,
> less fully formed, less alive and certainly less intelligent and more ugly than a dog or a cat,
> which may be strangled at birth without penalty!
>
> It is right to add, thought Des Esseintes, for further proof how monstrous the injustice is,
> that it is not the unskilful man, who generally makes off with all haste, but the woman,
> victim of his awkwardness, who pays the penalty for having saved an innocent from life!
>
> Verily the world must be extraordinarily prejudiced to want to suppress manoeuvres so natural
> that primitive man — that the very savages of the South Seas — have been led to practise them
> by the mere action of their own instinct!
>
> At this moment, his servant interrupted these charitable reflexions of his master by bringing
> Des Esseintes a silver-gilt salver [...]

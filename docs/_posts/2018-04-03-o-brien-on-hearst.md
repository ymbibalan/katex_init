I watched _Citizen Kane_ for the nth time last night. It's really so good!
On this viewing, besides an array of little things (how the opening and closing
shots match up, the underfed-looking elephant in the newsreel sequence, the
pterodactyls behind the picnic), I was particularly struck by how
"German Expressionistic" the whole thing looks. Lots of shadows and spotlights;
lots of gigantic rooms; lots of weird camera angles that make Kane look huge
and everyone around him small, or vice versa. I didn't quite come up with the
word "Expressionistic" on my own — that's Pauline Kael in her 1971 essay
[_Raising Kane_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_Kane),
which I found serendipitously in the process of googling which U.S. President
was supposed to be Kane's first wife's "Uncle John." (Hint: this President was
a Congregationalist.)

Apparently the received wisdom these days is that Kael plagiarized all her research
and was offensively unfair to Welles' legitimate genius; but hey, I thought it was
an illuminating piece of writing, regardless.

[William Randolph Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst),
unlike Charles Foster Kane, *was* elected to office —
two back-to-back terms (1903–1907) in the U.S. House of Representatives.
In 1906, he — like Kane — ran for, and lost, the governorship of New York State.
Here is an abridgement of [a speech](https://books.google.com/books?id=OCJvCV6_h_sC&pg=PA203)
given by [John F. O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._O%27Brien_(secretary_of_state))
_contra_ Hearst's cause. Dateline 1906:

> A demagogue is one who for selfish ends seeks to curry favor with the people or some
> particular portion of them, by pandering to their prejudices or wishes or by playing
> on their ignorance or passions.
>
> We are witnessing in the state of New York one of
> those tests of popular government which often have come in the past and always
> will come when a skillful demagogue attempts to get elected to office by exceeding
> all other men in the denunciation of real evils and in promises to cure them.
> Honest and well-meaning voters, smarting under the effects of political or social
> or business wrongdoing, naturally tend to sympathize with the man who expresses
> their feelings in the most forcible and extreme language, and who promises the most
> sweeping measures of reform; and in the excitement and heat of public indignation
> they are sometimes in danger of forgetting that he who cries "stop thief"
> the loudest may be merely seeking his own advantage, may be worthless as a leader,
> may belong to the criminal class himself.
>
> The enemies of popular government have always asserted that the great mass of a
> people, and particularly the working people, could not be trusted to reject
> appeals to passion and prejudice and follow the dictates of sober reason,
> to distinguish between mere words of violent denunciation and extravagant promise
> on the one hand, and proved capacity for useful and faithful service on the other,
> and that their suffrage would always go to the most violent and extreme agitator.
>
> The believers in popular government have always answered that in a country where
> universal education goes with universal suffrage, the great mass of the people,
> and particularly those who are doing honest work, can be depended upon to inform
> themselves carefully and to think soberly and clearly about political questions,
> and that their plain, strong, common sense will surely detect and reject the
> self-seeking demagogue, however violent his denunciation of wrong and however
> glowing his promises of redress, and approve the genuine man, the competent man,
> even though he may not promise so much or puff himself so much or use such
> violent language.
>
> I firmly believe that the contention of the friends of popular
> government is right; I believe that the people of this country and of this state,
> under our system of universal suffrage and universal education, are sure to come
> out right in the long run. Nevertheless it cannot be doubted that many workingmen
> in this state, good and honest men who are entitled to respect and who wish to do
> the best thing possible for their country, are about to strengthen the enemies
> and weaken the friends of popular government all over the world by voting for
> Mr. Hearst, who is just the kind of a demagogue that I have described.
>
> He is indeed an especially dangerous specimen of the class, because he is enormously
> rich and owns newspapers of wide circulation, and he can hire many able and
> active men to speak well of him and praise him in print and in speech and in
> private conversation.
>
> Not only is the cause of popular government in danger of suffering injury and
> discredit from the vote for Mr. Hearst, but genuine reform, the real practical
> redress of the evils complained of by the people, is in danger of being weakened
> and brought to naught by this attempt of Mr. Hearst to get himself elected
> governor of New York.
>
> The evils which have come with the enormous increase of corporate wealth in
> recent years are real and serious; there have been many outrageous practices
> which ought to be stopped and many wrongdoers who ought to be punished.
> That should be done, not by lynch law but by the intelligent and wise action
> which befits a self-governing people, determined always to maintain the rule
> of law, by reforming the laws where they are defective, and enforcing the laws
> with fearless vigor against rich and poor alike, and for the protection of rich
> and poor alike.
>
> Both of these require a high degree of intelligence, skill, and experience;
> declamation and denunciation and big headlines in the newspapers will not do
> the business. It is easy to cry "down with the corporations,"
> but corporations are merely the forms through which the greater part of our
> enormous business is transacted; they are not formed by special privileges
> to a few; they are free to all; anybody can form a corporation by signing
> and filing a paper, just as anybody can form a partnership.
>
> And the great mass of our business people, especially those engaged in manufacture,
> are doing their business through corporate form; our enormous manufacturing industry
> could not be carried on in any other way. If you destroy corporations, you close
> your mills and your furnaces, you stop the payment of wages, you destroy the
> purchasing power of the wage-workers, you reduce the sales of our merchants and
> the markets for farm products. Corporations are not bad in themselves, but the
> managers of some of them and of many of the greatest ones have used them as
> opportunities for wrongdoing, if not criminal wrongdoing.
>
> The thing needed is to cut out the wrongdoing and save the business, and these
> corporations are of so many different kinds, engaged in so many kinds of varied
> and complicated business, so intimately connected with all the production and
> trade and prosperity of the country, that the same kind of patient, experienced,
> and discriminating skill is needed for the process that the surgeon needs in
> cutting out a tumor from the human body and saving the life of the patient.
>
> [...]
>
> The structure of our prosperity will not be weakened, it will be made strong
> and enduring by removing with the care of the experienced builder the rotten
> timbers of disobedience to law and disregard of morality.
>
> The Republican Congress has stood loyally by the President; the act creating
> the Bureau of Corporations, the act expediting the trial of trust cases,
> the anti-rebate act, the
> act for the regulation of railroad rates, have made possible redress which was
> impossible before. Under the direction of two successive attorneys-general of
> the first order of ability, sincerity, and devotion, in hundreds of courts,
> incessant warfare has been waged and is being waged under the Federal laws
> against corporate wrongdoers.
>
> [...]
>
> The salt combination has been indicted and convicted and fined for failing to
> obey the judgment of dissolution. The Beef Trust has been indicted for failing
> to obey the injunction against it, and has been saved so far only by a decision
> that it had secured temporary immunity by giving evidence against itself.
> One branch of the Tobacco Trust is facing an indictment of its corporations
> and their officers in the Federal court in New York, and the other branches
> are undergoing investigation.
> The lumber combination in Oklahoma is under indictment.
>
> [...]
>
> It is seldom indeed that a man so young, whose public career has been so brief,
> so small a portion of whose life is known at all to the public, has furnished
> such convincing proofs of his unfitness for office. But the worst of Mr. Hearst
> is that with his great wealth, with his great newspapers, with his army of paid
> agents for his own selfish purposes, he has been day by day and year by year
> sowing the seeds of dissension and strife and hatred throughout our land; he
> would array labor against capital 
> and capital against labor; poverty against wealth and wealth against poverty,
> with bitter and vindictive feeling; he would destroy among the great mass of
> our people that kindly and friendly spirit, that consideration for the interests
> and the rights of others, that brotherhood of citizenship which are essential
> to the peaceful conduct of free popular government; he would destroy that respect
> for law, that love of order, that confidence in our free institutions which are
> the basis at once of true freedom and true justice.
>
> The malignant falsehoods of these journals, read by the immigrant in his new home
> where none can answer them, are making him hate the people who have welcomed him
> to liberty and prosperity, to abundant employment, to ample wages, to education
> for his children, to independence for his manhood, such as he has never
> known before.
>
> It is not the calm and lawful redress of wrongs which he seeks, it is the turmoil
> of inflamed passions and the terrorism of revengeful force; he spreads the spirit,
> he follows the methods and he is guided by the selfish motives of the revolutionist;
> and he would plunge our peaceful land into the turmoil and discord of perpetual
> conflict, out of which the republics of South America are now happily passing.
>
> Does any one question the justice of these statements? Then let him turn to
> the pages of the newspapers through the ownership of which Mr. Hearst is pressing
> his political fortunes. What public servant honored by the people's trust has he
> not assailed with vile and vulgar epithets; what branch of our free government
> has he not taught his readers to believe a corrupt agency of oppression!
>
> Listen to this from the _Journal_:
>
> > It is the sad duty of the _Journal_ to announce to the people of the United States
> > that their President, William McKinley, has deliberately tricked Congress and the country . . .
> > McKinley and the Wall Street Cabinet are ready to surrender every particle of national
> > honor and dignity. Congress and the people of the United States have been fooled,
> > tricked and deceived from the beginning to the end.
>
> And to this:
>
> > The Board of Elections has already begun its disgraceful and discreditable work.
> > It has allowed the People's petitions intrusted to its care to be marked and
> > mutilated and destroyed. It has thrown out petitions by the score and its action
> > has been sustained by the courts, even as the courts last year decided that you,
> > as citizens, had no right to have your votes honestly counted, but must abide by
> > any returns, no matter how false, of corrupt election officials.
>
> And to this:
>
> > The effort is being made now by the criminal trusts to crush out the power of the
> > people in the American Government. These trusts control your parties,
> > control your primaries, control your public officers, and deny you the right
> > to any government that will express the popular will. You are deserted and
> > betrayed by the public oficers that should sustain you, and by the so-called
> > free press that should support you.
>
> Joseph H. Choate, the leader of the American bar, whose honored and distinguished

> stigmatized as a "servile lickspittle of corporations."
>
> Fulton Cutting, ideal citizen, leader in philanthropy and independent politics,

> Theodore Roosevelt, president of the United States, is called "a loose-tongued

> and will live up to the bargain."
>
> Once only has this method of incendiary abuse wrought out its natural consequence —
> in the murder of President McKinley. For years, by vile epithet and viler cartoons,
> the readers of the _Journal_ were taught to believe that McKinley was a monster in

> these teachings:
>
> > McKinley condones the treacherous murder of our sailors at Havana and talks of
> > his confidence in the honor of Spain. He plays the coward and shivers white-faced
> > at the footfall of approaching war. He makes an international cur of his country.
> > He is an abject, weak, futile, incompetent poltroon.
> >
> > McKinley — bar [one girthy Princeton person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland),
> > who came to be no more or less than

> > The bullet that pierced [Goebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Goebel)'s chest  
> > Cannot be found in all the West;  
> > Good reason, it is speeding here  
> > To stretch McKinley on his bier.
>
> And this in April 1901:
>
> > Institutions, like men, will last until they die; and if bad institutions
> > and bad men can be got rid of only by killing, then the killing must be done.
>
> And this in June 1901:
>
> > There has been much assassination in the world, from the assassination of some

> > England who, driven to steal by hunger, were caught and hanged most legally. . . .

> > If Cromwell had not resolved to remove the head of Charles I from his lace collar,

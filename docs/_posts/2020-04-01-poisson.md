  - Teach the logic behind C-style declarations. `int *p` can mean "`p` is an `int*`,"
      and it can equally well mean "`*p` is an `int`." `int const *f()` can mean
      "You aren't allowed to modify the `int`," or it can equally well mean
      "You aren't allowed to modify `*f()`." (Of course this only works
      for pointers, not references; that's another reason it's important to reveal
      pointers early.)

  In [the Reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/fsyg1f/when_is_x_also_x/),
  commenter "redditsoaddicting" pointed out that this logic even works for multiple
  declarations on the same line:

  > In `int *p, q;`, the expression `*p, q` is of type `int`.

  Not only that, but after `const int& x(), *y;`, [we find](https://godbolt.org/z/8cL-wG)
  that `decltype(x(), *y)` is `const int&`!

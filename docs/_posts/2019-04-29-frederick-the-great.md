This rather cynical commentary on the role of "freedom of the press"
intrigued me and I did some googling into its background.

It appears that this quip was popularized by [Thomas Babington Macaulay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay)'s
biography of Frederick circa 1842, and in fact Macaulay probably invented it. The humorous story to which Macaulay attached it is older;
still, I doubt the story originated outside of 19th-century England.

The oldest source I can find is in [volume 9, number 24 of _The Olio; or Museum of Entertainment_](https://books.google.com/books?id=nkUAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA384)
(1832-06-09):

> ANECDOTE OF FREDERICK THE GREAT.
> One day, at Potsdam, the king heard from his cabinet a considerable tumult in the street;
> he called an officer and told him to go and ascertain the cause. The officer went,
> and came back to tell his majesty that a very scurrilous placard against his majesty
> was fixed on the wall, but that it was placed so high that a great crowd pressed forward,
> and were pushing each other to read it. "But the guards," he added, "will soon come and
> disperse them." "Do nothing of the kind," replied the king, "fix the placard lower down
> that they may read it at their ease."

The story was soon repeated by [H. L. Bulwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bulwer,_1st_Baron_Dalling_and_Bulwer)
[in the House of Lords](https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y1HAAAAYAAJ&dq=every.one.is.acquainted.with.the.anecdote.of.frederick&pg=PA3525)
(1832-08-02).

The placard anecdote next appears in Macaulay's _Frederick the Great_ (first printed in
[number 151 of the _Edinburgh Review_](https://books.google.com/books?id=k8lMAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA131),
April 1842); and it is capped with a quip which Macaulay attributes to Frederick...
but it seems to me that Macaulay probably originated the quip himself, since I can't find any
earlier source for it.

> Considered as an administrator, Frederick had undoubtedly many titles to praise.
> Order was strictly maintained throughout his dominions. Property was secure.
> A great liberty of speaking and of writing was allowed.
> Confident in the irresistible strength derived from a great army, the king looked down on
> malcontents and libellers with a wise disdain, and gave little encouragement to spies and informers.
> When he was told of the disaffection of one of his subjects, he merely asked,
> "How many thousand men can he bring into the field?"
>
> He once saw a crowd staring at something on a wall.
> He rode up, and found that the object of curiosity was a scurrilous placard against himself.
> The placard had been posted up so high that it was not easy to read it. Frederick ordered his attendants
> to take it down and put it lower. "My people and I," he said, "have come to an agreement
> which satisfies us both. They are to say what they please, and I am to do what I please."

Sometimes ([volume 3, number 15 of _Putnam's Monthly_](https://books.google.com/books?id=HUI9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA267), March 1854)
the quip was repeated without the accompanying anecdote:

> Character must be associated with great firmness and decision,
> and the man who has it will not be turned from his course by
> any amount of abuse, ridicule, or "[paper bullets of the brain](https://books.google.com/books?id=NlsMAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA65)."
> "My people and I," said Frederick the Great, "have come to an agreement
> which satisfies us both. They are to say what they please,
> and I am to do what I please." And he suffered all sorts of
> lampoons and satires to be written upon him.

The quip was repeated in
F.W. Longman's [_Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War_](https://books.google.com/books?id=K5ADAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA34) (1881),
and, separately, the placard anecdote was given a "happy ending" which had not appeared in earlier versions of the story.
Here's Longman's version, as what-sure-looks-like-plagiarized into Augusta Hale Gifford's
[_Germany, Her People and Their Story_](https://books.google.com/books?id=XHgBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA360)
(1899).

> Although he was despotic, Frederick allowed unparalleled freedom of speech.
> The liberty of the press was such in his time that it was no uncommon thing
> for satires to be published in Berlin which would not have been
> tolerated in any other capital in Europe.
> "My people and I," he said, "have come to an agreement which satisfies us both.
> They are to say what they please, and I am to do what I please."
> Both kept up the understanding quite generally throughout his reign.
> He was able to suffer this state of things to exist, because he knew he had
> the love and esteem of the greater part of his subjects, and he did not care
> what his enemies said about him.
> One day, as he was riding through Berlin, he saw a crowd of people looking at
> something high up on the wall, and sent his groom to inquire what it was all
> about. It proved to be a caricature of himself. It occupied so elevated a
> position that it was difficult to see it or read what was said about the king;
> so Frederick ordered that it should be placed lower, in order that the people
> might not tire themselves stretching their necks to look at it.
> He had hardly given the order when with a shout of joy the crowd
> pulled down the placard and tore it in pieces,
> giving the king a hearty cheer as he rode away.

Thomas Carlyle alludes to the placard story in [_History of Friedrich II of Prussia_](https://books.google.com/books?id=py41AQAAMAAJ&dq=too.high.posted&pg=PA205)
(1887), but does not repeat it wholesale, nor repeat Macaulay's quip.

Finally, by 1886, the anecdote had made its way back to Germany.
From [Karl Hillebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Hillebrand)'s
[_Zeiten, Völker und Menschen_](https://books.google.com/books?id=cZoBAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA287&dq=er.hätte.sicher.nicht.wie.friedrich.ii.das.verleumderische.Plakat.tiefer.hängen.lassen.damit.man.es.bequemer.lesen.könne) (1886),
speaking of [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) (1769–1821):

> Seine vollständige Nervenlosigkeit ... ihn nie verhinderte,
> seiner knabenhaften Empfindlichkeit gegen die Nadelstiche
> der Opposition, der Presse, der Salons nachzugeben.
> Er hätte sicher nicht wie Friedrich II. das verleumderische Plakat
> tiefer hängen lassen, damit man es bequemer lesen könne,
> er hätte es ungestüm abgerissen; so reizte ihn jeder Angriff,
> selbst der lächerlichste. Er verstand ebensowenig, wie ein
> gewisser großer Zeitgenosse — der freilich Nerven hat ...
>
> His complete lack of nerves ... never prevented him
> from yielding to his boyish sensitivity to the pinpricks
> of the opposition, of the press, of the salons.
> He certainly would not have allowed Frederick II
> to hang the slanderous placard lower, so that it would
> be easier to read; he would have ripped it off impetuously;
> so he was tempted by every attack, even the most ridiculous.
> He understood just as little as a certain great contemporary —
> who of course _has_ nerves ...

I think the "certain great contemporary" being needled here was
Hillebrand's contemporary [Otto von Bismarck](https://books.google.com/books?id=iD85AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA229&dq=thin-skinned)
(1815–1898). But it doesn't really matter whom you put upon the list...

UPDATE: The placard anecdote was present in Germany by 1849 (a mere seven years after
Macaulay), when it was referenced in
[a speech](https://books.google.com/books?id=DkpRAQAAMAAJ&dq=friedrich.ii&pg=PA467)
(1849-04-13) by [Julius Rupp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Rupp) in the _Zweite Kammer_
of the Prussian [_Landtag_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landtag_of_Prussia).
Could it be of German origin after all?

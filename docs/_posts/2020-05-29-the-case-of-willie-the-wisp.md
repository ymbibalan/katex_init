As a kid, I'd sometimes read a story where one line
has stuck with me over the years as the perfect
expression of some archetype. I find myself wishing
that other people knew these same stories, so that I could
actually _use_ these lovely shorthands.

One such story is "The Case of Willie the Wisp," from Donald J. Sobol's
_Two-Minute Mysteries_ (1967).
([Borrow it from the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/twominutemysteri00dona)
or [buy it on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3exTwD4).)
This gem of a book, from the creator of Encyclopedia Brown,
contains 79 separate mystery stories, each of which occupies
exactly one page.

> Dr. Haledjian [the famous sleuth] was vacationing in Europe
> when Count Schwinn, head of the customs in the country,
> requested help on a "perplexing problem of
> suspected smuggling."
>
> Schwinn had scarcely entered Haledjian's hotel suite
> when he blurted, "Are you acquainted with Eugene W.
> McNally?"
>
> "Better known as Willie the Wisp?" asked Haledjian.
> "He fenced diamonds in America for years and never got
> caught."
>
> "That's the man," replied Schwinn. "He's got a new game.
> Six months ago he showed up at our customs post at Durien
> driving a new black convertible Fiorta, a foreign car
> that costs eleven thousand dollars. Naturally, we checked
> every inch of it. Nothing. But each of his three pieces
> of luggage had a false bottom."
>
> Schwinn shook his head in exasperation. "In the false
> bottoms were three jars â€” one filled with molasses, one
> with ground oyster shells, and one with bits of colored
> glass. We couldn't hold him for hiding such things, naturally.
> Now twice a month here comes a big black expensive Fiorta
> into the country at Durien. Willie again! Hidden in his
> bags are the jars filled with the same curious contents:
> molasses, glass, and shells.
>
> "The brazen crook just sits and smiles at my customs men.
> They're forced to admit him into the country!" concluded
> Schwinn.
>
> "Molasses, shells, and colored glass," mused Haledjian.
>
> "What do they add up to?" cried Schwinn. "What's he smuggling?"
>
> Haledjian lit a pipe and drew upon it reflectively.
> At length he grinned. "Deuced clever fellow, Willie."
>
> _What was Willie smuggling?_

As with each of Sobol's one-page mysteries, the answer
is printed upside down at the bottom of the facing page:

> Willie was smuggling black convertible Fiorta automobiles!

I'm about two-thirds of the way through [Marie Corelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Corelli)'s
1895 novel [_The Sorrows of Satan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorrows_of_Satan),
about which I'll probably have more to say later. (Wikipedia tantalizingly claims that
this blockbuster best-seller owed its popularity "partly due to an upheaval in the system
British libraries used to purchase their books," which I suppose has something to do with
[the demise of the three-volume novel](https://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=richard-menke-the-end-of-the-three-volume-novel-system-27-june-1894);
I still don't really understand it.)

_The Sorrows of Satan_ follows one Geoffrey Tempest, millionaire, on his travels with a mysterious
and cultured friend named Lucio Rimânez who just might be Satan himself.
Yes, this is a very similar plot to that of James Hogg's 1824
_Confessions of a Justified Sinner_, as seen
[previously on this blog](/blog/2019/08/06/confessions-of-a-justified-sinner/).
But Corelli's "Lucio" has more of his own stuff going on than Hogg's "Gil-Martin."
He's not single-mindedly devoted to his protégé's advancement;
he also finds time for philosophical and cultural asides.

> But– do not frown, dear Miss Fitzroy!— I do believe in Heaven all the same,—

(Incidentally, the popularity of frivolous, juvenile, goose-winged-and-harped Heavens
[has only gone up](https://www.gty.org/library/Print/Blog/B121018) since Corelli's day,
and it's not _just_ Satan who quotes scripture against them.)

Now Lucio plays:

> With the first few bars he struck I half started from my chair in amazement;—
> could a mere pianoforte produce such sounds?— or was there some witchery hidden
> in the commonplace instrument, unguessed by any other performer?
> [...]
> The music swelled into passionate cadence,— melodies crossed and re-crossed each other
> like rays of light glittering among green leaves,— voices of birds and streams
> and tossing waterfalls chimed in with songs of love and playful merriment;—
> anon came wilder strains of grief and angry clamour; cries of despair were heard
> echoing through the thunderous noise of some relentless storm,— farewells
> everlastingly shrieked amid sobs of reluctant shuddering agony;— and then,
> as I listened, before my eyes a black mist gathered slowly, and I thought I saw
> great rocks bursting asunder into flame, and drifting islands in a sea of fire,—
> faces, wonderful, hideous, beautiful, peered at me out of a darkness denser than night,
> and in the midst of this there came a tune, complete in sweetness and suggestion,—
> a piercing sword-like tune that plunged into my very heart and rankled there,—
> my breath failed me,— my senses swam,— I felt that I must move, speak, cry out,
> and implore that this music, this horribly insidious music, should cease
> ere I swooned with the voluptuous poison of it,— when, with a full chord of
> splendid harmony that rolled out upon the air like a breaking wave,
> the intoxicating sounds ebbed away into silence.
> No one spoke;— our hearts were yet beating too wildly with the pulsations
> roused by that wondrous lyric storm. Diana Chesney was the first to break the spell.
>
> “Well, that beats everything I've ever heard!” she murmured tremulously.

I love that long lyrical paragraph (except perhaps that ungainly word "sword-like").
By serendipity I encountered it just after finishing
a re-read of Diane Duane's [_So You Want to Be a Wizard_](https://amzn.to/2Y1UWyR) (1983),
a book that I remember loving a couple decades ago. It hasn't aged quite as well for me as
has [_Dealing with Dragons_](/blog/2019/06/09/dealing-with-dragons/), but its
alternate-mecha-nightmare-Manhattan setting still resonates, especially now that I'm
living in New York, as the book is basically a love letter to New York City.
Anyway, _So You Want to Be a Wizard_ climaxes in a similarly lyrical paragraph,
as our pair of heroes incant a spell to untwist Manhattan from the grasp of
their own business-suited Satan-figure, the Starsnuffer.

> Kit began to read, and for all her fear Nita was lulled to stillness by wonder.
> Kit's voice was that of someone discovering words for the first time

> hearing the story told in what Kit read.

> Kit was invoking New York, calling it up as one might call up a spirit; and, obedient
> to the summons, it came. The skyline came, unsmirched by any blackness —
> a crown of glittering towers in a smoky sunrise, all stabbing points and jeweled windows,
> precipices of steel and stone. City Hall came, brooding over its colonnades,
> gazing down in weary interest at the people who came and went and governed the island through it.
> The streets came, hot, dirty, crowded, but flowing with voices and traffic and people,
> bright lifeblood surging through concrete arteries. The parks came, settling into place
> one by one as they were described, free of the darkness under the night —
> from tiny paved vest-pocket niches to the lake-set expanses of Central Park,
> they all came, thrusting the black fog back. Birds sang, dogs ran and barked
> and rolled in the grass, trees were bright with wary squirrels' eyes.
> The Battery came, the crumbling old first-defense fort standing peaceful now
> at the southernmost tip of Manhattan — the rose-gold of some remembered sunset
> glowed warm on its bricks as it mused in weedy silence over old battles won
> and nonetheless kept an eye on the waters of the harbor, just in case
> some British cutter should try for a landing when the colonists weren't looking.
> Westward over the water, the Palisades were there, shadowy cliffs with the Sun behind them,
> mist-blue and mythical-looking though New Jersey was only a mile away.
> Eastward and westward the bridges were there, the lights of their spanning
> suspension cables coming out blue as stars in the twilight.
> Seabirds wheeled pale and graceful about the towers of the George Washington Bridge
> and the Verrazano Narrows and the iron crowns of the 59th Street Bridge,
> as the soft air of evening settled over Manhattan, muting the city roar
> to a quiet breathing rumble. Under the starlight and the risen Moon,
> an L-1011 arrowed out of LaGuardia Airport and soared over the city,
> screaming its high song of delight in the cold upper airs,
> dragging the thunder along behind....

Incidentally, Wikipedia unreliably informs me that this January marked the final
commercial flight for the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. _Mais où sont les aéronefs d'antan?_

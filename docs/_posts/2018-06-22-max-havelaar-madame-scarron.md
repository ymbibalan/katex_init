Currently reading [_Max Havelaar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Havelaar) (1860),
"the Dutch _Uncle Tom's Cabin_." From Chapter 12, in the middle of a dinner party
where Max has just wound up one of his long stories:

> "Dear Max," said Tine, "our dessert is so scanty— would you not— you remember
> Madame Geoffrin—?"

At first I didn't recognize this name as a reference to anything outside the book
at all. But whatever version is [on Wikisource](https://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Max_Havelaar_of_de_Koffij-veilingen_der_nederlandsche_Handelmaatschappij_-_Deel_20)
includes a footnote from the author:

> It seems to me that [Mr Van Lennep](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uitgeefgeschiedenis_van_Max_Havelaar)
> mistakenly changed this to "Madame Geoffrin." In the manuscript it was "Madame Scarron."
> [Madame Geoffrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Thérèse_Rodet_Geoffrin),
> being very rich, had no need to augment her meager dishes with storytelling.
> Moreover, I know for sure that some writers assign the well-known anecdote
> to Madame Scarron. —[EDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multatuli)

Madame Scarron is (slightly) better known today as
[Madame de Maintenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Françoise_d%27Aubigné,_Marquise_de_Maintenon),
second wife of Louis XIV. Scarron was her first, and poorer, husband.
[Arsène Houssaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsène_Houssaye)
[writes](https://books.google.com/books?id=pylPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA246):

> Little by little, Scarron's royalty vanished from his house before the splendor of his wife's.
> It was no longer his society, but hers, that people sought. She had, says Monsieur de Noailles,
> "acquired a most winning style of conversation; and every one has heard of the servant who one
> day at table whispered in her ear: 'Madam, here's another capital subject for a story—
> we have no meat for dinner.'&#8202;"

That's a slight embellishment of what
[de Noailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul,_6th_duc_de_Noailles)
actually [wrote](https://books.google.com/books?id=bFUBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA144),
but it's also funnier, so I'll take it.

Speaking of signed integer overflow and other such thorny issues...

On 1893-11-18, Pope Leo XIII issued the encyclical
*[Providentissimus Deus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providentissimus_Deus)*.
In this letter, among much else, the Pope [writes](http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18111893_providentissimus-deus.html) as follows:

> In the second place, we have to contend against those who, making an evil use of physical science,
> minutely scrutinize the Sacred Book in order to detect the writers in a mistake, and to take occasion
> to vilify its contents. Attacks of this kind, bearing as they do on matters of sensible experience,
> are peculiarly dangerous to the masses, and also to the young who are beginning their literary studies;
> for the young, if they lose their reverence for the Holy Scripture on one or more points, are easily
> led to give up believing in it altogether.

And again:

> There can never, indeed, be any real discrepancy between the theologian and the physicist, as long as
> each confines himself within his own lines, and both are careful, as St. Augustine warns us, "not to
> make rash assertions, or to assert what is not known as known." If dissension should arise between them,
> here is the rule also laid down by St. Augustine, for the theologian: "Whatever they can really
> demonstrate to be true of physical nature, we must show to be capable of reconciliation with our
> Scriptures; and whatever they assert in their treatises which is contrary to these Scriptures of ours
> ... we must either prove it as well as we can to be entirely false, or at all events we must, without
> the smallest hesitation, believe it to be so."

And again:

> The unshrinking defence of the Holy Scripture, however, does not require that we should equally uphold
> all the opinions which each of the Fathers or the more recent interpreters have put forth in explaining
> it; for it may be that, in commenting on passages where physical matters occur, they have sometimes
> expressed the ideas of their own times, and thus made statements which in these days have been abandoned
> as incorrect.

And again:

> We recognize without hesitation that neither the extent of the matter nor the time at disposal allows
> each single Book ... to be separately gone through. But the teaching should result in a definite
> and ascertained method of interpretation — and therefore the Professor should equally avoid the mistake of
> giving a mere taste of every Book, and of dwelling at too great length on a part of one Book.
> If most schools cannot do what is done in the large institutions — that is, take the students through
> the whole of one or two Books continuously and with a certain development — yet at least those parts which
> are selected should be treated with suitable fulness; in such a way that the students may learn from
> the sample that is thus put before them to love and use the remainder of the sacred Book during the
> whole of their lives.

Leo concludes:

> The principles here laid down will apply to cognate sciences ...

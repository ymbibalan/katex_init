Today I finished reading _Les Fleurs de Tarbes_
([Jean Paulhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Paulhan), 1949),
subtitled _ou la terreur dans les lettres_ — that is, _The Flowers of Tarbes,
or, Terror in Literature_. The version I was reading was [Michael
Syrotinski's 2006 translation](https://amzn.to/2MaCrT0).

"Terror" in this context is a reference to the French revolutionary
[Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror), which Paulhan
seems (I don't know any of his other work) to be using as a metaphor for
"revolution" — the exploding of tradition, the pursuit of novelty and
creative genius, the devaluing and reviling of cliché in all its forms.
The problem Paulhan runs into, I think, is that this "terrorist" attitude
is so ubiquitously popular that he can find it literally anywhere; and so
the book occasionally slips into being nothing more than a catalogue of
things Paulhan personally doesn't like, each with the label "terror" attached.

However, there are three or four thought-provoking pages in the book...
and they probably aren't going to be _as_ thought-provoking when starved of
the surrounding pages' context. (Readers of my blog might be
able to relate!)

> [Bergson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Bergson) points out [...]

> nature: the latter is fugitive, personal, unique; the former is fixed,
> shared, abstract. Consequently, thought, which in any case has to go through
> the language that expresses it, is thereby altered, and becomes in its turn,
> because of this constriction, impersonal and drained of all its color. [...]
> Which of us has not felt thwarted in advance and as if deformed by the words
> we are about to say?
>
> Here [...] we run into obstacles: first of all, that it is unwise to reduce
> all language to _expressing_ thoughts. [...]
>
> But even if I grant that all language expresses something, I do not in the least
> consider that this expression must necessarily diminish me. Quite the opposite
> [...] Our language, said [Comte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte),
> teaches us about ourselves; or, as [Rilke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke)
> put it, reveals us to ourselves.

> But supposing I want all language to express something, and all expression
> to constrict us. It would still have to be proven that this constriction is permanent.
> Here again I can see quite the opposite [...]
> The survivor of a shipwreck waving a cloth rag on his raft communicates his hunger,
> his thirst, and his worry very poorly. Before speaking of the strange simplifying
> effect that the rag has on him, I would really like to be sure that his worry,
> his hunger, and his thirst will not return as soon as the ship has passed him by.

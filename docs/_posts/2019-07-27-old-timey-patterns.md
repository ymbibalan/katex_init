One of the things I pulled off of my old floppy disks
(["Making floppy disk images under OS X"](/blog/2019/07/26/disk-images-in-os-x/), 2019-07-26)
was a program called "PATTERNS.C". Its timestamp is 2000-09-24, or right about
the start of eleventh grade for me. What does it do? Well, first I'll explain it
mathematically, and then I'll show you what it looks like live.

It's a cellular automaton that runs in a 31-by-31 grid of cells.
Each of these cells can be in either of two states: "live" or "dead."
At each time-step: each cell with an odd number of live neighbors
becomes "live"; each cell with an even number of live neighbors becomes "dead."

The "neighbors" of a cell are its [Von Neumann neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood)
(just the four cardinal directions, no diagonals).

In "PATTERNS.C", the grid does not wrap; instead, cells at the edge of the grid
act as if their missing neighbors are "dead." This will be important in a minute.

In "PATTERNS.C", I actually used four states: the "dead" state and three
different "live" states. The different "live" states are used to track the "age"
of a living cell. On each turn in which a cell doesn't move into the "dead" state,
it moves to the next greater "live" state; unless it has already reached state 3,
in which case it just remains there. The extra states don't much change the
mathematical properties of the automaton; they just add some visual interest.

Now for the sad part. No matter what pattern of cells you start with, if you
run the automaton for exactly 32 time-steps, you'll wind up with a grid consisting
entirely of "dead" cells. Each living cell in the starting configuration sends out
"waves" that bounce off the boundaries of the grid and ultimately cancel each other
out.

Now for the happy part! If you stop after 31 time-steps, the configuration
displays surprising, intricate, even beautiful symmetry.

My lovely wife and I have just moved house, and while boxing up the contents
of my desk I ran across physical paper copies of two weakly themed crosswords
I made in 2011. Might as well immortalize them in the digital realm...

I created crosswords for Carnegie Mellon's student newspaper,
[_The Tartan_](https://thetartan.org/2006), circa 2003–2006.
In those years, I developed a suite of crossword-related software utilities
to help a crossword constructor (that is, me) with things like
laying out a symmetrical grid and even filling in the "fill" between
theme entries. (Filling in an irregular space with words from a dictionary
can be approached as an exact-cover problem, for which Donald Knuth's
[Dancing Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) algorithm
is very well suited.) However, _these_ two crosswords are dated
2011-11-10, and were definitely constructed without recourse to
`xword-fill`. They're also hand-numbered "#2" and "#3" respectively;
I no longer have any recollection of what happened to "#1."

I decided this would be a good time to pull out the old `xword-typeset`
utility and see if it still worked. After a little massaging of the
15-year-old code to deal with recent innovations such as "unused variable
warnings" and "UTF-8"... it works great! See the code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Quuxplusone/xword).

    git clone https://github.com/Quuxplusone/xword
    cd xword
    make xword-typeset
    curl -O https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/code/2021-08-24-crossword2.txt
    ./xword-typeset 2021-08-24-crossword2.txt > 2021-08-24-crossword2.tex
    pdflatex 2021-08-24-crossword2.tex
    open 2021-08-24-crossword2.pdf

Another way these puzzles are products of their time: `CRT` appears as a fill entry
in both. According to [XwordInfo.com](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder),
2011 was right on the exact cusp where the _New York Times_ stopped
pairing `CRT` with clues like "Computer screen, for short" and started
giving it clues such as "Passé PC piece," "Old oscilloscope part, briefly,"
and "Bygone monitor, for short."

For those reading the code of `xword-typeset` and wondering what "HWEB" is:
It was my own prehistoric dialect of what today we'd call
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The syntax, like
the name, was just some mashup of bits of HTML and bits of
Knuth's CWEB. Its only relevance to `xword-typeset` is that to
italicize part of a clue you use `/slashes/`
(whereas modern Markdown uses `_underscores_`).

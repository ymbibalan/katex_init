I've just finished reading John Masefield's _The Box of Delights_ (1935).
I had picked it up at random in a tourist-trap gift shop several months ago,
knowing only that it appeared vaguely Christmassy — not knowing at the time
that it is (apparently) a giant of British Christmas pop culture, on par with
_The Nutcracker_.

The version I got was the [NYRB Children's Collection edition](https://amzn.to/34PjMX8),
which ends with a "Note on the Text" from the Archivist of the John Masefield
Society pointing out some of the editorial choices made in this particular
edition. (Apparently Masefield's manuscript included several scenes that were
removed or altered in some printed versions, and vice versa.) I had already
been thinking, "I wish there were _The Annotated Box of Delights_ with footnotes
on some of this stuff!"

Some of the footnotes have been covered by Jake Hayes at "Tygertale":

- ["_The Box of Delights_ — A Glossary"](https://tygertale.com/2018/12/03/the-box-of-delights-a-glossary/) (Jakes Hayes, December 2018)

And some of the footnotes I could write myself:

- Who are Punch and Judy? what is a Christmas cracker?
    what are [Hundreds and Thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpareils) (p. 119)?
    what is the difference between the nave and the transept? who was Miss Garbo (p. 246)?

- What did [gorging Jack say to guzzling Jimmy](https://www.bartleby.com/360/9/84.html) (p. 204)?

- What are the [Chorasmian Wastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarazm)
    and the [Gedrosian Wastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedrosia) (p. 212),
    and did Masefield invent the Acheronian Wastes the same way he seems to have
    invented Saint Cosric?

- Why do [Herne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herne_the_Hunter)'s unicorns
    "hate being [beaten by the lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn#Nursery_rhyme)"
    (p. 284), and how does this relate to the "sideways crosses"
    [on Herne's ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Cross)
    and [on the Lady's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Andrew%27s_Cross)?

- How do [twelve chimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Quarters) indicate
    that it's a quarter to midnight (p. 288)?

- What other excellent children's books feature [people who are very small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borrowers);
    [phoenixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phoenix_and_the_Carpet) (p. 76);
    a boy turned by his mentor [into a fish and then into a bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_(novel)) (p. 78);
    children [taking pemmican on sea-voyages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallows_and_Amazons) (p. 120);
    and [beautiful Ladies driving sledges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe) (p. 281)?

Many of the footnotes require more specific research; such as, at least,
reading _The Midnight Folk_ to find out what's the deal with Abner Brown and Sylvia Daisy Pouncer;
or computing how much snow you'd need to achieve "drifts eight feet deep" (p. 235).

And many require more knowledge of English and specifically Anglican history;
such as, at least, knowing what Cole Hawlings is getting at with "Christian times,
then another in-between time, then [Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell)'s time,
and then pudding time" (p. 31), or how a dean outranks an archdeacon (p. 246).

If Martin Gardner were still alive, I think _The Annotated Box of Delights_
would be a perfect project for him. You may know that Gardner wrote
[_The Annotated Alice_](https://amzn.to/37T2AlD) (1959) and
[_The Annotated Snark_](https://amzn.to/34JsTbN) (1962); but I recently
learned via Dana Richards' 2018 lightning talk
["Martin Gardner: Annotator"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcjoYvyYkvo)
that Gardner effectively _invented_ the "Annotated X" art form!

Gardner also produced [_The Annotated Ancient Mariner_](https://amzn.to/2M2POZc) (1965)
([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/annotatedancient0000cole/mode/2up)),
[_The Annotated Innocence of Father Brown_](https://amzn.to/2WPwW28) (1987)
([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/annotatedinnocen00ches/mode/2up)),
and many others.

(I personally grew up with a copy of Isaac Asimov's
[_Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan_](https://amzn.to/34JflgA) (1988), which is
unrelated except in that it's annotated and I enjoy it immensely.)

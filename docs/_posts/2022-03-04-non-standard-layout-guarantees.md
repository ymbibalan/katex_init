In C++, we have the notion of "standard layout." A standard-layout class type
is basically guaranteed to be laid out in memory the same way as a plain old
C struct: the first data member goes at offset zero, and subsequent members
are laid out at increasing addresses in declaration order (possibly with some
gaps for padding).

    struct A { int i; int j; } a;
    struct B { int m; int n; };

Both C and C++ have always guaranteed that `(int*)&a == &a.i`, and even
that `offsetof(A, j) == offsetof(B, n)`. These guarantees are due to the fact
that `A` is a [standard-layout](https://eel.is/c++draft/class.prop#3) type
that's [layout-compatible](https://eel.is/c++draft/class.mem#general-23)
with `B`. The rules for what kinds of classes count as standard-layout have
drifted a bit over the years
(see [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/StandardLayoutType)),
certainly anything that would have compiled in C89 will count as
standard-layout in C++ forever.

However, there is a second layout guarantee in C++ that applies to _all_ class types,
regardless of whether they're standard-layout or not!
Consider the following class type ([Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/oaPxfbzhK)):

    struct C {
        int a;
        int b;
    private:
        int c;
    public:
        int d;
    } c;
    static_assert(&c.a < &c.b);

Ever since C++98, it's been guaranteed that `&c.a < &c.b`.
C++98's [expr.rel] (page 86):

> If two pointers point to nonstatic data members of the same object,
> or to subobjects or array elements of such members, recursively,
> the pointer to the later declared member compares greater

This is consistent with the idea that `a.i` must precede `a.j` in the
memory layout of the [POD](/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#pod)
type `A`, but it's even stronger — because it also governs
the layout of non-POD types like `C`.

Notice that in C++98, there was no guarantee that `&c.b < &c.c`, nor that
`&c.b < &c.d`, because those members' declarations _are_ separated by
access-specifier labels. C++98 guaranteed no reordering within a single
access specifier's "block" of data members, but still permitted reordering
among those "blocks." For example, the compiler might (if it wished) lay out
`C`'s members in the order `a b d c` (private members at the back); or `c a b d`;
or even `d c a b` (blocks ordered back to front). A really evil implementation
might even order them as `a c d b`, since that technically conforms to the guarantee.

Between C++98 and C++11, the notion of "POD type" was replaced with the conjunction
of "standard-layout type" and "trivial type," and in the process the layout guarantee was
strengthened to enable the programmer to interrupt a run of public members with some
private member functions, or vice versa, without breaking ABI. That is, C++11 forbid
the compiler to swap two "blocks" of data members with the same access. Since `C`'s
members `a`, `b`, `d` are all public, C++11 required the compiler to lay them out
in exactly that order — but still didn't restrict the placement of `c` relative
to the public members.

Finally, in C++23, [P1847R4 "Make declaration order mandated"](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1847r4.pdf)
removes _all_ of the compiler's freedom to reorder the layout of data members... at least,
for data members declared directly within the same class. I believe (and Clang agrees)
that the standard still says nothing about inheritance situations such as:

    struct Base { int i; };
    struct Derived : Base { int j; } d;
    static_assert(&d.i < &d.j); // Not guaranteed even in C++23

Here's a table summarizing the history of the standard's layout guarantees for
non-standard-layout types like `C`.
Please keep in mind that this table's "Allowed" column is _100% purely hypothetical_ —
it's what the [DeathStation 9000](https://web.archive.org/web/20150619140401/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CompuHacker/CHDS9000)
might have chosen to do. No actual shipping compiler has ever done any of these
things, as far as I know (except for one near miss, mentioned in the numbered note below).

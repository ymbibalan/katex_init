![I actually use west const exclusively, myself](/blog/images/2018-03-15-east-const-west-const.jpg)

Background via [Jon Kalb](http://slashslash.info/2018/02/a-foolish-consistency/):

> Notice that the rule for const placement is:
>
> > `const` modifies what is on its left.
> > Unless there is nothing on its left, in which case it modifies what’s on its right.
>
> If you consistently place const after what it modifies, the rule becomes much simpler:
>
> > `const` modifies what is on its left.
>
> [...] Recently, I’ve noticed that more and more C++ programmers are starting to adopt
> this style. In fact, a few months ago, I learned that it had a catchy name: *East const.*

[Previously on this blog](/blog/2019/01/10/happy-mmxix/#i-met-dr.-knuth-a-couple-of-time):
Back in 2014 I had conjectured that the optimum solution for two armies was the following.
(Each region has size $$\left(1 - {\sqrt{3}\over 2}\right) \approx 0.13397$$.) This morning
I learned that I was _very_ wrong about that!

|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|

Last night I was noodling on this problem again (for the more-than-two-army case) and came up with
this knight's-move-inspired solution for 4 armies. Each home-plate-shaped region has size
exactly 0.05.

|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| [![Four encampments of size 0.05 each](/blog/images/2019-01-21-one-20th.png)][2] |

In the above image, I used two colors to illustrate the four-army solution — so the four-army
solution (also [here][3]) happens to double as a two-army solution of size 0.1. But what if we take that solution and
rearrange the colors so that the friendly armies are next to each other instead of diametrically
across the board from each other? I expected a modest increase, but after making the switch and
jiggling it a bit, I arrived at _this_ interesting configuration!

|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| [![Two encampments of size 0.1458 each](/blog/images/2019-01-21-1458.png)][4] |

The vertical lines divide the unit square into fourths; the slashing lines divide the sides of the unit
square at the 1/3 and 2/3 marks. So each home-plate-sized region has size
$$\frac{19}{288} \approx 0.06597$$,
and each slashing region has size $$\frac{23}{288} \approx 0.07986$$,
for a total army size of $$\frac{7}{48} \approx 0.1458$$. Wow!

If we take the same four-army solution and color _just two_ armies with the same color,
then we get a three-army version. Jiggling that version arrives at these two solutions for
three armies. The left-hand solution has army size $$\frac{1}{15} \approx 0.0667$$; the
better right-hand solution has army size $$\sim 0.0718$$. I have not yet done the math
to describe this solution algebraically.

Here are two solutions for five armies. On the left, encampments of size
$$\sim 0.0298$$; on the right, encampments of size
$$\frac{7}{225} \approx 0.0311$$. Thanks to Benoît Jubin for doing the math on
the latter! Benoît also informs me that you can _very slightly_ widen the central
encampment here to achieve encampments of size $$\sim 0.031188383$$.

Here are four solutions for six armies, of sizes
$$\sim 0.0104$$, $$\sim 0.0133$$, $$\sim 0.0140$$, and (my best attempt) $$\sim 0.0211$$, respectively.
Again I haven't done the math to describe these algebraically.

| [![Six encampments of size 0.0140 each](/blog/images/2019-01-21-six-army-0140.png)][10] | [![Six encampments of size 0.0210 each](/blog/images/2019-01-21-six-army-0211.png)][11] |

For seven armies, a solution of size $$\sim 0.0149$$.

|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| [![Seven encampments of size 0.0149 each](/blog/images/2019-01-21-seven-army-0149.png)][13] |

My best solution for eight armies is based on a solution to the [eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle);
specifically, arrangement number 10 on Wikipedia's list of the 12 distinct arrangements that solve the puzzle.
Solutions based on the other 11 arrangements are
[available on my GitHub](https://github.com/Quuxplusone/PeacefulEncampments/tree/eightqueens-solutions)
in a rough, unfinished form. This solution has armies of size $$\sim 0.0115$$.

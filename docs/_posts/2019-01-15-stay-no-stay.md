From [_How Apollo Flew to the Moon_](https://books.google.com/books?id=x-taL4N0sjIC&pg=PA310)
(W. David Woods, 2011). It is July 20, 1969, and the Eagle has just landed:

> Go/no-go decisions had punctuated the flight thus far and now
> the flight director wanted his controllers to make another,
> this time on whether the surface phase of the mission should
> continue — but he wasn't going to call it "go/no-go."
> It had been pointed out by Bill Tindall that in the heat
> of an emergency, "Go" could easily be construed as advice to
> get out of there as much as an instruction to continue with the
> planned mission and stay on the surface. Therefore this call
> was "stay/no-stay."

[Howard Wilson "Bill" Tindall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Tindall) (1925–1995),
Chief of Apollo Data Priority Coordination, had responsibilities described
by Wikipedia as "wide-ranging." His attention to detail went as far as optimizing
the ergonomics of terms like "go/no-go."
[Here is Tindall's original note](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tindallgrams01.pdf),
from NASA's [archived collection](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-Tindallgrams.html) of
the memos affectionately known as "Tindallgrams."

The memo continues for another five paragraphs on the "major items":

> Last summer [GAEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman) honored us with their presence at one of our meetings
> and to celebrate the occasion we give them an action item. We asked them

(Incidentally, given the Internet Archive's heroic efforts to archive content from
Tumblr before it went down, I'm starting to wonder if they're putting a similar
contingency plan in place for the U.S. federal government.)

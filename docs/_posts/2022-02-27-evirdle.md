Has it been a week since [Birdle](https://quuxplusone.github.io/wordle-clone/birdle/) already?
Wow. Anyway, I've made another Wordle variant. I call this one [Evirdle](https://quuxplusone.github.io/wordle-clone/evirdle/),
because it is evil. It tries to make your Wordle experience as _challenging_ as possible.

"Challenging" is a tricky metric. [Evirdle](https://quuxplusone.github.io/wordle-clone/evirdle/)
is superficially similar to Sam Hughes' [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html),
but I found that Absurdle had two annoying flaws:

- It's deterministic (as far as I can tell). The same sequence of guesses always leads to the same answer.

- It has a tendency to end up with answers in the same set of boring double-letter words, like MAMMA or PAPPA,
  or at best FIZZY or JIFFY.

So Evirdle adds a little bit of randomness, and also disqualifies some boring words, resulting
in what I subjectively think is a more challenging experience. The average Evirdle game looks something
like this:

> Evirdle SNOWY 4/6
>
> â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ  
> â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨  
> ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ  
> ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Not only that, but its Settings menu contains a switch labeled "Easy Mode"!
What that switch does is left as an exercise for the reader.

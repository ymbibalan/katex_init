On November 18, 1883, the United States introduced standard time zones.

From the "Railway Record" on page 3 of [_The Memphis Daily Appeal_, Saturday, November 17, 1883](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045160/1883-11-17/ed-1/seq-3/):

> Mr. D. W. C. Roland, general superintendent of transportation
> of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, has issued
> a circular instructing "all hands" on that road that on Sunday,
> November 18th, at 10 o'clock a.m., the standard time of all
> divisions of this road will be changed from the present standard,
> Louisville time, to the new standard, ninetieth meridian or
> central time, which will be 18 minutes slower than the present
> standard time. At precisely that hour, by the present standard
> time, all trains and engines, including switch-engines, must come
> to a standstill for 18 minutes, wherever they may be, and all
> watches and clocks of all employees must be turned back 18 minutes,
> which will be the new standard time. Other instructions are given
> in the circular with regard to the manner of adopting the new
> system of time not necessary here to print.

And from the front page of [_The Evening Star_ (Washington, D.C.) on Saturday, November 17, 1883](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1883-11-17/ed-1/seq-1/):

> PUT THE CLOCK FORWARD.  
> The New Time Standard to Become Effective To-morrow.  
> What Will Be Done in Washington.  
>
> To-morrow the public at large not dependent for their supply of time
> upon the "[time ball](https://www.cincinnatiobservatory.org/media/documents/How_Time_Balls_Worked.pdf)" at the observatory will begin to regulate their
> affairs upon the new time standard, giving Washington the time of the
> 75th meridian, which is 8 minutes and 12 seconds faster than the real
> time of Washington, as registered by the daily transit of the sun over
> our meridian. Towns that have never laid claim to a meridian will have
> no embarrassment in effecting a change of time, but in this city, as the
> meridian is recognized as a government institution, according to the recent
> rulings, the actual Washington meridian time will continue to be the
> official time.

> THE RAILROADS.  
> "It won't disturb us a particle," said Superintendent Sharpe, of the Baltimore
> and Potomac road, to a STAR reporter this morning; "as a matter of fact it
> will not disturb any railroad. The time is easily enough arranged."
>
> "Then the new time will go into effect 'on time' to-morrow," said
> the reporter.
>
> "Yes, promptly at twelve o'clock," said Mr. Sharpe.
>
> "I should think that it would cause confusion at first," said the reporter.
>
> "It will cause confusion may be for the public," said Mr. Sharpe, "but as a
> matter of fact it will make very little difference on our road. We have always
> run by Philadelphia time, and this new standard makes a difference of only one
> minute and three seconds. Heretofore when we advertised a train to leave at
> 11 o'clock it left really at 11.07, according to Washington time."
>
> The change on the Baltimore & Ohio road will go into effect at 2 o'clock
> to-morrow morning, at which time the new schedule recently adopted will become
> operative. It is thought that by making the change at 2 o'clock Sunday morning,
> an hour when there are few trains running, there will be little confusion.
>
> THE BANKS.  
> A bank official, talking to a STAR reporter to-day, said that there had been
> no agreement as to the time to be employed in banking business. As a matter of
> fact, it would make little difference, as a margin was always allowed to cover
> any discrepancy in the clocks.
>
> THE JEWELERS OF THE CITY,  
> who are the dispensers of time for the majority of people, will, as a rule,
> keep both times, so that their patrons can take their choice. Arrangements have
> been made so that the observatory will send both times to the jewelers.
>
> Messrs. Galt, Brother & Co. will, on to-morrow, at noon, set the large clock
> in front of their building to the time of the 75th meridian. Their regulator
> inside, which is connected by wire with the U.S. observatory, will, as heretofore,
> show the time of the meridian of Washington. Mr. M. W. Galt said to a STAR reporter
> that he thought that the new time would necessarily prevail in the general course
> of business, as the railroads and the post office would be regulated by that time.
> As the new time is faster than the old, no one will be late, if they regulate their
> movements by it.
>
> Mr. Karr, the jeweler, stated to a STAR reporter that whatever time the Observatory
> furnished would be supplied by the jewelers who had electric connection with the
> Observatory. He is having a dial with two rows of figures made for the large clock in
> his window, so that it will give both times. Some of the jewelers of the city are in
> favor of holding a meeting to arrange for the adoption of one time or the other
> throughout the city. The majority have decided to keep both times. Samuel Lewis' Sons
> are the only ones who have positively declared in favor of the new time exclusively.
>
> THE CITY BELLS.  
> There was some doubt at fire alarm headquarters this morning as to what time the bells
> would announce to the public hereafter. As usual, on Sundays, the bells will not ring
> at noon to-morrow, but will ring at 6 p.m., which will be the first time the bells will
> tell the time after the new standard goes into effect. An official of the observatory
> visited the office this afternoon and stated that the old Washington time would be rung
> on the bells. This is in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary of the Navy.
> The matter, it is stated, was made the subject of Cabinet consideration yesterday.
> Circulars sent out from the observatory to-day explained the system of time signals,
> and said that Washington time would be sent from the observatory. The difference between
> Washington time and the 75th meridian time is stated in the circular.

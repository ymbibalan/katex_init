CppCon 2021 starts in just a few days! As in 2019 and 2020, CppCon 2021 will have a "Back to Basics"
track. The Back to Basics track's mission (in phrasing newly refined for 2021) is:
<b>Top trainers clearly explain all the essential topics of modern C++.</b>

Each session in the track is about a <b>single concrete topic</b>, often expressible in
just one or two words: Pointers. Templates. Lambdas. One way I justify this naming scheme is to
[picture an imaginary attendee](https://spaciousacting.com/2014/07/25/actor-etiquette-deaf-lady-back-row/).
They are conscious of having only a tenuous understanding of _foo_. So they attend the
talk titled "Back to Basics: _Foo_," and (if the talk is intelligible to them)
they'll leave the room with a reasonable working knowledge of _foo_.

Each session in the track is <b>presented by an expert instructor.</b> We aim to get presenters
who are not only experts on the technical material, but also experts at presentation and
instruction.

Each session aims to <b>present time-tested guidelines</b> that are aligned with mainstream C++
and broadly useful across many industries. We fit these sessions together like jigsaw
pieces to produce a track that covers "everything you need to know" to be a working
programmer in today's C++ community.

The Back to Basics track is <b>part of the main conference program.</b> You don't need any special ticket
to attend any of the track's talks. You can freely mix B2B talks with non-B2B talks in your schedule.
Finally, the B2B track _will_ be recorded and captioned and put up on YouTube with the rest of
the main program.

Here's this year's [Back to Basics lineup](https://cppcon2021.sched.com/tag/Back+to+Basics).
Notice that it's not really in any sensible order this year — to the extent that we have one
talk scheduled _after_ the track's "closing keynote" — and it's heavily weighted toward
the beginning of the week. None of this scheduling originates with me! It was largely an artifact
of this year's "hybrid" conference model: some speakers require certain timeslots because
they're speaking remotely, and the whole schedule is somewhat front-loaded so that if
there are last-minute technical difficulties with a session we can reschedule it for
later in the week.

My understanding is that, for the sessions I've marked "online," there will _not_ be any designated
way for in-person attendees to watch those talks (except ad-hoc via the hotel wifi). Vice versa,
all of the unmarked sessions will be in-person _and_ live-streamed to online attendees; except
for Mike Shah's "Concurrency," which will _not_ be live-streamed but _will_ be re-broadcast
about 20 hours later for the online attendees.

All times are Denver time.

A famous exchange recorded in Charles Babbage's
[_Passages from the Life of a Philosopher_ (1864)](https://books.google.com/books?id=2T0AAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA67):

> On two occasions I have been asked,—
> "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures,
> will the right answers come out?" ...
> I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas
> that could provoke such a question.

Often when explaining technical material I encounter questioners
who raise what I have come to think of as "Pray-Mister-Babbage problems."

However, it should be noted that many modern technologies —
[error-correcting codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code),
static analysis, spell-check, UX design — are essentially attempts to deal with specific
Pray-Mister-Babbage problems in a legitimate and non-dismissive way!

In fact, Babbage's own book continues:

> I did, however, explain the following property, which might in some measure
> approach towards an answer to it.
>
> It is possible to construct the Analytical Engine in such a manner that
> after the question is once communicated to the engine, it may be stopped
> at any turn of the handle and set on again as often as may be desired.
> At each stoppage every figure-wheel throughout the Engine, which is capable
> of being moved without breaking, may be moved on to any other digit.
> Yet after each of these apparent falsifications the engine will be found
> to make the next calculation with perfect truth.

(This is an early allusion to a kind of error-correcting code. Did you catch also
Babbage's early form of undefined behavior? The user may adjust any figure-wheel
"which is capable of being moved without breaking." If you force any other wheel,
you'll find yourself with a broken Analytical Engine. I hope the distinction between
moveable and non-moveable figure-wheels was apparent to the novice!)

And Babbage concludes his chapter by resuming the curmudgeonly position:

> The explanation is very simple, and the property itself useless.
> The whole of the mechanism ought of course to be enclosed in glass,
> and kept under lock and key, in which case the mechanism necessary
> to give it the property alluded to would be useless.

(This is an example of "seeing the rabbit-hole and refusing to go down it,"
an action I take with disappointing infrequency.)

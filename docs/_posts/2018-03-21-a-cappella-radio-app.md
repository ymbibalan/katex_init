Rush hour thoughts: You know how digital radio just cuts out to silence when there's
atmospheric noise or concrete in the way? I want an app (for one of these always-listening
devices like the Amazon Echo, or just an opt-in smartphone app) that will notice when
there's music that suddenly cuts out, and then fill the silence with its own improvisation
until the radio comes back in.

I'm sure all the building blocks already exist. Where's the button I click to download
this thing already?

Key search terms: audio texture synthesis, algorithmic improvisation.

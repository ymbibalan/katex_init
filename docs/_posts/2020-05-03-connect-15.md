Here's a simple two-player card game you can play while stuck at home.
I invented it sometime before 2003 — I would guess circa 1999.
I call it "Connect Fifteen."

You'll need a deck of playing cards and a table with a straight edge.

## Setup

Separate out the ace through 7 in all four suits, and then put away the
other cards; you won't use them. Give one player the black suits and
the other player the red suits. In this game the ace has value 1.

The players take their respectively colored cards (14 each)
and shuffle them face-down.  The two decks are then placed
face-up in view of both players, so that each player can
always see his own and his opponent's next card.

## On your turn

Starting with the red player, players alternate turns
placing cards on the playing field as in Connect Four.
That is, a card may be played vertically above any existing card,
or it may start a new column immediately left or right
of the existing columns, on the "baseline" represented by
the edge of the table.

Unlike Connect Four, the "grid" in this game is infinitely
spacious to left and right, as well as infinitely tall.
Also unlike Connect Four: When creating a new column,
you are never allowed to leave any empty columns
between your new column and the existing tableau.

Players may only look at their opponent's top card, and at
the card they are currently needing to place. In particular,
you aren't allowed to look at your _next_ card until you've
decided where to place your _current_ one!

The first player to place three or more of his own cards in a
contiguous straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
so that the pips on the aligned cards total 15 or greater
wins the game.

## Sample game

The following picture highlights the three places
the black player may legally place their first card:

Black plays their 6 in the existing column.
Red observes Black's next card (a 5) and then plays their 4 in a new column,
forming an open line of total value 3+4=7 along the baseline.

Black plays their 5 in a new column to the left, blocking one end
of Red's line.
Red observes that Black really wants to play the black 4 on top of that 5
(which would form a horizontal line of value 10 _and_ a vertical line of
value 9, _possibly_ threatening a win) and therefore plays their ace to
block that spot.

Black plays their 4 in the rightmost existing column, revealing that
Black's next card is a 7. Black is now threatening to play in the highlighted
spot to form a diagonal line of value 5+6+7 ≥ 15, so Red is forced to block.

Black plays their 7 in a new column... and reveals another 7!
Red's own 7 comes too late to help; Black is now threatening to win
in either of the locations highlighted below.

Red chooses to block the horizontal line. Black plays their 7
in the second column to create a diagonal line of value 7+4+7 ≥ 15
and win the game!

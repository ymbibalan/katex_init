Right now you can register for a full week of CppCon 2018 for the
low low price of only $845.  On July 7th, early-bird registration
closes, and the price goes up to $995.

Some people are probably waiting to see what the program schedule
looks like, before they commit to the price tag. If you're in that
category, _stop waiting!_ I promise it'll be a great lineup, at least
equal to the lineup in previous years (for example:
[2016](https://cppcon2016.sched.com/), [2017](https://cppcon2017.sched.com/)).
It's not going to be worse than that. So if you're "kinda interested,
but holding out" — please don't hold out so long that you miss the early-bird
discount!

Plus, you can take that $150 you saved on early-bird registration and put
it toward registration for [a weekend class](https://cppcon.org/classes-2018/),
such as the one I personally am teaching — 
"[The Standard Library from Scratch](https://cppcon.org/the-standard-library-from-scratch/)."
For your (or your company's) additional $850, you'll get about 14 hours
of class time, hands-on exercises (I use [Wandbox](https://wandbox.org/)),
free hot lunches both days, and two extra evenings to explore Seattle!

There is no early-bird discount for the weekend classes. You can always register for
the conference now and decide to add on a class or two later. The main reasons
to register for a class early are to help solidify your travel plans — where
time is money — and to avoid the unlikely-but-possible scenario that the
class completely fills up.

----

Speakers whose [CppCon submissions](https://cppcon.org/cfs2018/) were accepted
will have their conference fee waived (and should register using a special code).
Speakers whose submissions were rejected will still get the Early Bird price
regardless. This means that *if* you submitted a session this year, then you
*shouldn't* rush to register before the Early Bird deadline; you should wait
at least until you've heard whether your session was accepted or not.

Accepted and/or rejected speakers do *not* get any special discount on
weekend classes, as far as I know.

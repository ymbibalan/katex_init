Now it happened that over the whole land there was a great famine. In a certain village,
the people were starving. One day down the dusty road came a stranger, carrying a bulky pack.
He stopped in the village square.

"I hear this village is in need of _soup_," he called.

The villagers were naturally wary of strangers, even strangers bearing bulky packs
and talking of soup. But then the stranger set down his pack and began to pull things from it.
The curious villagers gathered round. They were _very_ hungry.

First the stranger took out three long poles and a heavy iron pot. He filled the pot
with water from the village pump and hung it on the three poles. Then he took out a shiny
copper ladle and placed it in the pot. Finally, he took from the pack a large smooth stone.

He placed the stone in the pot.

"Stone soup," said the stranger, "is the best soup. All it needs now is a few carrots
for flavor."

The villagers were excited at the prospect of soup. They were so _very_ hungry!
Many of the villagers immediately volunteered to take turns stirring the pot,
using the stranger's shiny copper ladle.

"I've heard that several of our village's shopkeepers have some carrots," piped up
an old woman in the crowd. "Somebody should go ask them for their carrots."

Other villagers brought firewood, and soon there was a roaring fire under the pot.

The water began to bubble and boil.

"I wish we had some rosemary, or maybe some thyme," said a cook in a tall hat.
"Rosemary and thyme can really improve the taste of a soup." But none of the villagers
knew where to get either of those things.

"That's all right," said the stranger confidently. "Once we've served the soup,
each person can add rosemary and thyme to their own personal taste. Honestly,
it's better that way."

----

Word of the stranger and his soup was spreading through the village. Some villagers brought
bits of string to add to the pot. Another brought a handful of thumbtacks.

The pot had been boiling for quite some time now. The villagers stirred and stirred.
New wood was brought for the fire. The sun reached the top of the sky and started down again.
But the soup wasn't finished.

A handful of villagers hung back.

"I don't want to eat this soup," said the village baker.

"Why not?" asked the other villagers. "Aren't you just as hungry as we are?"

"I'm willing to eat this soup," said the village butcher, "as long as it's got some
carrots in it. Where are those carrots?"

Nobody was quite sure. Besides, except for the specific reference to carrots, the
butcher's argument was the same as the baker's earlier argument, which had
already been refuted.

"This whole thing is merely a distraction from our _real_ work," said a shoemaker,
"which is catching rats to eat. Every person making soup is taking away from our
other efforts!"

But the villagers rebuked him. They pointed out that nobody was being _forced_ to
help with the soup. They pointed out how good the soup would taste when it was done.
Most importantly, they pointed out that talk was cheap. If the shoemaker didn't like
how this soup was being made, why didn't he go make his _own_ soup?

-----

The sun went down. Some of the villagers went home. Some of them stayed, to keep
the fire burning and the copper ladle stirring. When the sun came up, the soup was
still cooking.

Some of the villagers thought that the soup — which was still just a pot of water,
a large stone, and some bits of string (after some careful consideration, they had fished out
the thumbtacks) — should really be called more of a "stew." Others thought it would
be more accurate to call it a "bouillabaisse," even though nobody was quite sure
what the word meant.

The skeptics began to gather again.

"Look," said the village blacksmith, "this stone soup really doesn't seem appetizing.
But if you really want something like it, you don't need this stranger with his pot.
You just—" and he dumped a few pebbles into his teacup. "Easy peasy," he said.

Some of the villagers gathered around the pot disputed that the blacksmith's
pebble-tea was really anything like their stone soup. Others thought it _was_
pretty similar, at that. But the stranger's soup was a _communal effort_.
When it was ready, the whole village could eat it together.
You couldn't solve the famine, they said, with one-off cups of pebble-tea.

"Frankly, I don't think we should be wasting our time on soup at all," said the village innkeeper.

"But," replied the villagers, "don't you remember how delicious soup can be?
Remember being a child, and eating soup. We just want to give that same
experience to _our_ children."

"Maybe we should investigate other forms of food," said the innkeeper.
"For example, I have heard that sandwiches taste all right."

But sandwiches were not soup, and what was being stirred in the pot was
clearly intended to be a _soup_. Even if the whole group were to change
direction and pursue sandwiches instead, you can't make a sandwich in a pot of water!

The sun reached the top of the sky and started down again.

Even a few of the villagers helping with the soup started to lose faith.
Some privately admitted that the soup itself might not be very good, but
at least it would provide a great motivation for bread bowls.
Everybody in the village was excited by the prospect of bread bowls.
They were so _very_ hungry!

"I'm starting to think that nobody will want to eat this soup," said the
village carpenter. "Look. It's full of dirt." But everyone knew that
_somebody_ wanted to eat the soup, or it wouldn't be getting stirred.
Besides, the carpenter's argument was just a more generic version of the
baker's argument from yesterday, which had already been refuted.
And _besides_, everybody knew that children liked to eat soup.

"I have heard," said the village milliner, "that several villages in
the next county over have their own soup. I don't think they started with stones.
Maybe we could copy what they did."

This news alarmed the villagers. If their own village remained soupless for long,
people who wanted soup might start leaving. They might go to the next county.
They might move away forever! "It is very important that we complete our
work on this soup," the villagers agreed.

"That's not what I meant," said the milliner.

The sun went down. Some of the villagers went home. Some of them stayed, to keep
the fire burning and the copper ladle stirring. When the sun came up, the soup was
still cooking.

_Sorry to end this story on a cliffhanger, but I actually have no idea
how to wrap it up. How would you like this story to end?_

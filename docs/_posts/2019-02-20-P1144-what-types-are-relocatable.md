In my libc++ fork implementing library support for
[P1144 "Object relocation in terms of move plus destroy,"](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1144r2.html)
I have [a unit test](https://github.com/Quuxplusone/libcxx/blob/trivially-relocatable/test/libcxx/type_traits/is_trivially_relocatable.pass.cpp)
that tests `std::is_trivially_relocatable_v<X>` for every library-provided type `X`
that I can think of. Here is that same list of library-provided types, in convenient tabular format,
for each of the Big Three implementations (libc++, libstdc++, and MSVC). The results for libc++
are accurate. The results for libstdc++ and MSVC are my best guesses based on whatever homework
I've done up to this point. I will endeavor to fix bugs in this table as they are reported.

The rightmost column, "Lowest," shows the lowest common denominator: what we could mandate
in the Standard without causing any ABI breakage for vendors.

Key:
- `✓✓` means it's always trivially copyable (which implies trivially relocatable).
- `✓` means it's always trivially relocatable.
- `C` means it's a template that is _conditionally_ trivially relocatable.
- `No` means it's never trivially relocatable.
- `D` means it's never trivially relocatable in debug mode, but always trivially relocatable in release.
- `CD` means it's never trivially relocatable in debug mode, but conditionally trivially relocatable in release.
- `?` means I haven't hazarded a guess yet.

The following types aren't relocatable at all (because they aren't move-constructible):
`atomic<T>`, `atomic_flag`, `condition_variable`, `condition_variable_any`,
`lock_guard<T>`, `mutex`, `seed_seq`, `random_device`.


## Notes applicable to both libc++ and libstdc++

- `list`, `set`, and `map` all contain "end nodes" stored inside themselves (so, there are pointers from the heap to the object itself).

- `any` can store non-trivially-relocatable types inside its SBO buffer.

- `packaged_task` contains a `function`.

- `smatch` contains a `vector`.

- `exception` and `error_category` have non-final virtual destructors.

- `regex` does not contain a `string`; it contains a `shared_ptr` to a DFA.

- `basic_regex` contains a member of type `Traits`, so `basic_regex` is trivially relocatable iff `Traits` is trivially relocatable.

- `regex_traits<char>` contains a member of type `locale`, so it's not trivially copyable.

- `exception_ptr` and `locale` are just gussied-up (copy-only) `shared_ptr`s.

- `type_index` is just a gussied-up raw pointer to a `type_info`.


## Notes on libc++

- "Debugging" for containers means `_LIBCPP_DEBUG_LEVEL >= 2` (which is the same thing as `_LIBCPP_DEBUG_MODE`).

- `function` contains a pointer to its own SBO buffer.

- `function` can store non-trivially-relocatable types inside its SBO buffer.

- `vector::iterator` and `unordered_map::iterator` hold (possibly fancy) `pointer`s, so they're trivially relocatable iff the allocator's `pointer` type is trivially relocatable.

- `vector<bool>::iterator` is not trivially copyable. (Making it so would be an ABI break.)

- `valarray` is basically a `vector` as far as its memory management is concerned. It stores two pointers.


## Notes on libstdc++

- `function` will store `T` inside its SBO buffer only if `__is_location_invariant<T>`. This special trait is true only for trivially copyable types and for a specific `packaged_task` helper type.

- `deque` allocates a (sort of) "sentinel node" on the heap even in its default constructor, so it is not nothrow-move-constructible; nonetheless it is (conditionally) trivially relocatable.

- `vector::iterator` holds a (possibly fancy) `pointer`, but [`unordered_map::iterator` holds a raw pointer](https://godbolt.org/z/cT0uDj); the latter is always trivially relocatable as far as I can tell.

- `allocator` is not trivially copyable. (Making it so would be an ABI break.)

- `ostream_iterator` is not trivially copyable. (Making it so would be an ABI break.)

- `valarray` is basically a `vector` as far as its memory management is concerned. It stores a pointer and a length.


## Notes on MSVC

- `list` allocates a "sentinel node" on the heap even in its default constructor, so it is not nothrow-move-constructible. However, as far as I can tell, it _is_ (conditionally) trivially relocatable.

- `any` will store `T` inside its SBO buffer only if `is_trivially_move_constructible_v<T>`; but it permits `!is_trivially_destructible_v<T>`. There is a fast path for trivially copyable types.

- `function` can store non-trivially-relocatable types inside its SBO buffer.

- `vector::iterator` and `unordered_map::iterator` hold (possibly fancy) `pointer`s, so they're trivially relocatable iff the allocator's `pointer` type is trivially relocatable.

- `pmr::polymorphic_allocator` (correctly) has `=delete`d assignment operators, and MSVC (incorrectly) [reports such types as non-trivially copyable](https://godbolt.org/z/xf42b0). I've recorded it as trivially copyable with an asterisk.

- `locale` and `exception_ptr` are just gussied-up (copy-only) `shared_ptr`s.

- `valarray` is basically a `vector` as far as its memory management is concerned. It stores a pointer and a length.

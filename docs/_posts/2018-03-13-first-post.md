I've been putting off creating a blog for years now, because I dreaded being one of those blogs
where they put up an enthusiastic "First post!!" and then go dark for three years. But lately
I've been hanging out on the [C++ Slack channel](https://cpplang.slack.com) and I keep finding
myself in discussions (okay, occasionally they're "debates") where I say something and think,
"Gee, I wish I could save that comment and repost it the next five times I'm discussing this
same topic with someone who isn't here right now!"

So this morning I went looking for a way to host a blog right here on GitHub and write posts
in Markdown... and lo and behold, googling "github markdown blog" led me straight to
[a blog post by Joseph Tyler Jones](https://howchoo.com/g/yzg0yjdmntl/how-to-blog-in-markdown-using-github-and-jekyll-now)
describing how to do exactly that using ["Jekyll Now"](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now),
a project by Barry Clark. So I followed the instructions to fork the Jekyll Now repository,
change some YAML config, upload the photo of myself you see above, and ta-da, it Just Worked!
So, thanks to those guys (and presumably some others as well).

Now all I need to do is figure out how to [add tags to Jekyll posts...](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/214)

As of a couple days ago, the sessions I presented at C++Now 2018 are up on YouTube!
(They are not [captioned](http://cppvap.wikidot.com) yet, but I'm working on it.)

- ["An Allocator is a Handle to a Heap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY):
A memory resource is an object type. An allocator (in the C++-allocator-model sense)
is a handle _to_ a memory resource, which makes it a value type. This is obvious in
the `std::pmr` world, but true even when it's not obvious. (An allocator can have
other orthogonal bits besides just the handle. "Sticky" allocators, like
`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, have a whole bunch of pitfalls.) Discussion of
how allocators, and fancy pointers, form "rebindable families."

- ["The Best Type Traits C++ Doesn't Have"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWBfmmg8-Yo):
First, the vast majority of standard C++ types are _trivially relocatable_, which essentially
means your `vector` can use `realloc` (or at least `memcpy`) under the hood, even for
non-trivially-moveable types. Second, many types are _trivially comparable_, which
essentially means your `vector::operator==` can use `memcmp` under the hood. (It's easier
to be _trivially comparable_ on a big-endian system.) Thirdly, I present a mechanism
called _tombstone traits_ which shrinks the size of an `optional<optional<...optional<T>>>`
(nested `K` levels deep) from libc++'s current `sizeof(T) + 8*K` bytes to a constant
`sizeof(T) + 8` bytes (and in fact `sizeof(T)` for small `K`).

I have submitted "An Allocator is a Handle to a Heap" for [CppCon 2018](https://cppcon.org/timeline2018/),
as well as two other talks (one on Concepts and [one on copy elision](https://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Bay-Area/events/248040207/)).
I will also be running a two-day post-conference class,
["The Standard Library From Scratch"](https://cppcon.org/the-standard-library-from-scratch/),
covering the same material as last year.

I _didn't_ submit "The Best Type Traits C++ Doesn't Have" for CppCon, but [I'll be presenting it
at the Bay Area C++ meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Bay-Area/events/251133806/)
in Santa Clara this Wednesday, 2018-06-06.

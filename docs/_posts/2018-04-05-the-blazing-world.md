This week I've been reading [_The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World_](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51783),
a science-fiction "novella" of sorts by [Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Cavendish,_Duchess_of_Newcastle-upon-Tyne),
published 1666.

It's quite... heterogeneous. It veers from charmingly naive escapism (which I keep
mentally associating with [Daisy Ashford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Visiters)
although I'm not sure that's quite appropriate; and bear in mind that Cavendish was 39 when
she wrote this passage) —

> No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her to be some
> Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused [...]
> At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power
> to rule and govern all that World as she pleased. But her subjects, who could
> hardly be perswaded to believe her mortal, tender'd her all the Veneration and
> Worship due to a Deity.
>
> Her Accoustrement after she was made Empress, was as followeth: On her head she
> wore a Cap of Pearl, and a Half-moon of Diamonds just before it; on the top of her
> Crown came spreading over a broad Carbuncle, cut in the form of the Sun; her Coat
> was of Pearl, mixt with blew Diamonds, and frindged with red ones [...]

— to a shotgun approach to Aristotelian natural philosophy —

> Concerning the heat of the Sun, they were not of one opinion; some would have the
> Sun hot in itself, alledging an old Tradition, that it should at some time break
> asunder, and burn the Heavens, and consume this world into hot Embers, which,
> said they, could not be done, if the Sun were not fiery of itself. Others again
> said, This opinion could not stand with reason; for Fire being a destroyer of
> all things, the Sun-Stone after this manner would burn up all the near adjoining
> Bodies: Besides, said they, Fire cannot subsist without fuel; and the Sun-Stone
> having nothing to feed on, would in a short time consume it self; wherefore they
> thought it more probable that the Sun was not actually hot, but onely by the
> reflection of its light; so that its heat was an effect of its light, both being
> immaterial. But this opinion again was laught at by others, and rejected as
> ridiculous, who thought it impossible that one immaterial should produce another;
> and believed that both the light and heat of the Sun proceeded from a swift
> Circular motion of the Æthereal Globules, which by their striking upon the
> Optick nerve, caused light, and their motion produced heat: But neither would
> this opinion hold; for, said some, then it would follow, that the sight of
> Animals is the cause of light; and that, were there no eyes, there would be
> no light; which was against all sense and reason.

— and then she hits you with satirical passages reminiscent (premoniscient?) of
_Gulliver's Travels_ (1726).

> [The Empress] commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers,
> to observe [the stars] through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which
> they did according to her Majesties Command; but these Telescopes caused more
> differences and divisions amongst them, than ever they had before [...]
>
> After they had thus argued, the Empress began to grow angry at their Telescopes,
> that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she, now I do plainly perceive,
> that your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude
> your Senses; Wherefore I Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust onely
> to their natural eyes, and examine Cœlestial Objects by the motions of their own Sense
> and Reason. The Bear-men replied, That it was not the fault of their Glasses, which
> caused such differences in their Opinions, but the sensitive motions in their Optick
> organs did not move alike, nor were their rational judgments always regular: To which
> the Empress answered, That if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie
> their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason
> more regular than Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deluders, and will never
> lead you to the knowledg of Truth; Wherefore I command you again to break them;
> for you may observe the progressive motions of Cœlestial Bodies with your natural
> eyes better than through Artificial Glasses. The Bear-men being exceedingly troubled
> at her Majesties displeasure concerning their Telescopes, kneel'd down, and in the
> humblest manner petitioned, that they might not be broken; for, said they, we take
> more delight in Artificial delusions, than in Natural truths. Besides, we shall
> want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects for Arguments; for, were there
> nothing but truth, and no falshood, there would be no occasion to dispute,
> and by this means we should want the aim and pleasure of our endeavors in
> confuting and contradicting each other; neither would one man be thought wiser
> than another, but all would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools;
> wherefore we most humbly beseech your Imperial Majesty to spare our Glasses, which
> are our onely delight, and as dear to us as our lives.

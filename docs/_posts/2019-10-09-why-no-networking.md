Recently, in a discussion of the Networking TS on one of WG21's internal "reflector" mailing lists,
Bjarne Stroustrup wrote:

Billy O'Neal wrote a very long and detailed answer to the stated question.
(This was not a reply targeted at Bjarne specifically; this was a detailed answer
suitable for people who ask questions like "why doesn't C++ have networking support?")
I think Billy's answer is great and deserves wider viewership, so I asked Billy and Bjarne
for permission to share it here, and they said "Feel free."
So: Billy, why doesn't C++ have networking support in the standard library?

Disclaimer: I don't fully understand point (6). As best I understand it (with some further help from
Billy off-list), it's basically the point that if programmers come to believe that "C/C++ networking"
is equivalent to "[Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) vulnerabilities,"
then they might reasonably avoid C++ for networking — use a "safer" language for all their
networking needs — at which point it doesn't matter whether C++ ever provides standard networking,
because nobody would trust such a standard networking library in production.

Other than perhaps point (6), I think I agree wholeheartedly with everything Billy said.

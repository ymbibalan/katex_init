Here's another [Binary Homeworlds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14634/homeworlds) puzzle,
inspired by Raymond Smullyan's _[The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes](https://amzn.to/37BjnIa)_.

For details of how I created the puzzle, how I created the image (thanks to Sleafar on Puzzling
StackExchange!), and where to get your own physical set of Homeworlds pieces,
see [the first post in this series](/blog/2020/05/29/homeworlds-mini-doomsday-machine/).


## The puzzle

Holmes and Watson happened to be passing by the table just as Lee made his move in a game of Homeworlds.
The position after Lee's move was:

![A graphical representation of the game state.](/blog/images/2020-06-16-the-prestige.png)

    Lee (0,r3g1) y3b2-r1
    Ray (1,y3b2) -y2y1b2
    DS1 (g2) -b3b3y3
    DS2 (b3) -r1g1y2
    DS3 (b1) y1y1-b1b1
    DS4 (g1) -y2r1

(The stash contained `r3r3r2r2r2 g3g3g3g2g2`.)

"Interesting move, Lee," said Watson. "You know, if you had moved your blue ship just now,
you would have put Ray in check."

"Yes," replied Lee; "but if I'd done that, then Ray surely would have responded by
catastropheing half of my home star!"

*What was Lee's last move?*

Via Hacker News and [Roger Curry's blog](http://lateralscience.blogspot.com/2014/10/scottish-nitroglycerin-one-legged-stools.html),
a description of Alfred Nobel's dynamite factory in North Ayrshire.
[H.J.W. Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_J._W._Dam)
writes in _McClure's Magazine_ (1897) of the many security precautions taken at
["The Great Dynamite Factory at Ardeer."](https://books.google.com/books?id=NweGtIVlP6AC&pg=PA823)
First, all entrants must be stripped of all metal objects that might cause a spark.

> To enter the "Danger Area" you must pass the "searcher." [...]
> He is a tall, military-looking man in a blue uniform faced with red,
> and he takes from you all metallic objects — your watch, money, penknife,
> scarf-pin, match-case, matches, and keys. None of these is allowed to be
> where nitroglycerin is. [...]
>
> At this point, too, you get your first glimpse of the "costumes."
> A man in a Tam o' Shanter cap comes up clothed from head to foot in vivid scarlet.
> He belongs to a nitroglycerin house. Then comes a man in dark blue — a "runner,"
> or carrier of explosives. Then comes a man in light blue, who belongs to a
> smokeless-powder factory. [...] The different colors are used so that a
> superintendent at any distance can always tell if a man is on his own ground
> and attending to his own work.
>
> [...] As you enter the nitrating house your eye is caught by two lead cylinders,
> five feet in diameter and six feet deep [...] At the farther cylinder sits a man
> in scarlet watching a thermometer. He neither moves, looks up, nor betrays any sign
> of your presence. The thermometer which he is watching is five feet in length.
> Only the top or marked portion extends above the cylinder[.]
> In the cylinder has been placed about a ton and a half of sulphuric acid
> mixed with a ton of nitric. Into this mixture are now being sprayed 700 pounds
> of glycerin [...]
> Great heat is caused by the chemical action, and the absolute necessity is that
> the heat shall be kept down or it will explode the newly formed nitroglycerin.
> To this end the cylinder is surrounded by a water-jacket, through which cold water
> is rushing constantly, and four concentric coils of lead pipe occupy the interior
> of the cylinder, carrying four steady rushes of cold water.

Another alleged aspect of the system, which _McClure's_ doesn't mention
but _Arms & Explosives_ (1917) [does](https://books.google.com/books?id=BvpYAAAAYAAJ&q=one-legged),
was that the thermometer-watcher was permitted to rest only on an unstable one-legged stool:

> All the operator has to do is to sit on a one-legged stool and watch a thermometer.
> Should he fall asleep the construction of the stool ensures an automatic and rude
> awakening. The stool is known as the Scotch system.

(This strikes me as one of the _least_ clever pieces of the system, honestly.)
Anyway, resuming Dam's account of the cylinder-room:

> If the heat, through vagaries in the glycerin, rose above the danger point,
> the thermometer would instantly reveal this to the man on watch.
> If the thermometer rose ever so little above twenty-two degrees centigrade,
> the man would turn on more air and shut off the inflow of glycerin.
> If it continued to rise slowly and he could not stop it by more air and water,
> he would give a warning shout, "Stand by," to a man watching below.
> If it continued, he would shout, "Let her go," and the man would open a valve;
> this would sweep the whole charge down to a "drowning-tank" lower down the hill,
> which would drown the coming explosion in [an] excess of water.
> The two men the meanwhile would bolt to a safe position behind banks.
> If the heat rose rapidly, too rapidly for "drowning," the man would pull the valve,
> give a warning shout, and run. So would everybody, you included.

Notice the detailed and multi-layered plan here. The "banks" to which Dam refers are
earthwork mounds which surround every building in the factory complex.

> At half past six on the morning of the 24th of February, one week after the writer's
> visit to [the dynamite "mixing-house"], it was the scene of a very disastrous explosion.
> Twenty-four hundred pounds of nitroglycerin was collected here, in the tanks and boxes
> mentioned, and from some cause which may never be known it exploded, killing six people
> — a chemist, a foreman, and four workmen. A few other employees were slightly hurt by
> flying débris. [...]
> That over a ton of nitroglycerin can explode in the heart of a factory where 1,300 people
> are at work, and only the six men, within a few feet of it, lose their lives,
> shows better than any other evidence the meaning and value of the Ardeer mounds.

Speaking of large explosions, I've recently been reading primary accounts of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

* ["The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/mpmenu.asp)
    compiled by the Army Corps of Engineers (1946-06-29).

* ["Hiroshima,"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima) by John Hersey,
    in the _New Yorker_ (1946-08-24).

Hersey's article, which synthesizes many eyewitness accounts from both Japanese and foreign-born
occupants of Hiroshima, contains a quotation from Father John Siemes of Tokyo Catholic University;
Siemes' full account of the Hiroshima bombing (including the bit Hersey quotes)
is included as an appendix to the Army report.

One particular note from the Army report:

> A reference to the various photographs depicting damage [in Nagasaki]
> shows that although most of the buildings within the effective limits of the blast
> were totally destroyed or severely damaged, a large number of chimneys even close to X
> were left standing, apparently uninjured by the concussion. One explanation is that
> concrete chimneys are approximately cylindrical in shape and consequently offer much
> less wind resistance than flat surfaces such as buildings. Another explanation is that
> since the cities were subject to typhoons the more modern chimneys were probably designed
> to withstand winds of high velocity. It is also probable that most of the recently constructed
> chimneys as well as the more modern buildings were constructed to withstand the acceleration
> of rather severe earthquakes. Since the bombs were exploded high in the air, chimneys
> relatively close to X were subjected to more of a downward than a lateral pressure,
> and consequently the overturning moment was much less than might have been anticipated.

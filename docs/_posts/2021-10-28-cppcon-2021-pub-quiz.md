excerpt: |
  [CppCon 2021](https://cppcon.org/program2021/) is half over already. Tonight I emceed
  the first game of the third annual CppCon "C++ Pub Quiz." Herb Sutter offered opening remarks,
  and then joined one of our seven teams for a few rounds of play.
  What is C++ Pub Quiz, you ask? It's a straightforward trivia night — five rounds,
  ten questions per round, write down your team's answers on a sheet of paper and turn it in
  at the end of the round. High score after five rounds wins the game.

  Seven teams participated in this year's Pub Quiz.
  The winning team of the night was Team BYOB, with a score of 33 points, just edging out
  Team Hufflepuff at 32. Third place went to Rotate! That's A with 30 points. Thanks also
  to Symbol Not Found; Unit Tested; the Reference ₩rappers a.k.a. UB Unicorns; and Flying Blind.

Last year, when CppCon was entirely online, the Pub Quiz was online too. This year, I returned
to the in-person-only format. Sorry, online-conference attendees! Maybe we'll see you here
next year.

Seven teams participated in this year's Pub Quiz.
The winning team of the night was Team BYOB, with a score of 33 points, just edging out
Team Hufflepuff at 32. Third place went to Rotate! That's A with 30 points. Thanks also
to Symbol Not Found; Unit Tested; the Reference ₩rappers a.k.a. UB Unicorns; and Flying Blind.
It seemed like a good time was had by all. I certainly had a good time quizmastering!

A sample round of C++ Pub Quiz looks something like this:

1. For one point each, name the two authors of the 2001 book _Accelerated C++_.

2. In what standard library header are you guaranteed to find the declaration of `std::terminate`?

3. Name the creator of the `sendmail` program, who also lent his name to a style of indentation
   for curly-brace languages that puts each brace on a line by itself.

4. What command-line option would I pass to enable Clang's "UBSan" sanitizer?

5. Name the C++ build system developed by Jussi Pakkanen, which shares a name with
   the class of hadrons composed of an even number of quarks.

6. What happens in the destructor of a joinable `boost::thread`?

7. In 1995, Todd Veldhuizen wrote an article in _C++ Report_ describing a technique
   for evaluating vector and matrix expressions in a single pass without temporaries.
   Name that technique, which was also the title of his article.

8. In the C++20 acronyms "GMF" and "PMF," the "M" stands for "module," and the "F"
   stands for what eight-letter word meaning a syntactic subdivision?

9. Name the charitable organization headed by Vinnie Falco, René Rivera, and Jon Kalb,
   whose stated mission is to "empower the C++ community" and "promote the general
   welfare of the C++ programming language," and which administrates
   [cpplang.slack.com](https://cppalliance.org/slack/).

10. If `T` is an alias for `int&`, what type is `const T&`?

Special mentions go to:

- Flying Blind, the only team to score zero points on the multiple-choice round.
  If you guessed randomly, you'd have a 1-in-182 chance of getting every single
  question wrong — yet they managed it!

- Team Hufflepuff, the only team to recognize "_Motorcar champagne, legit toxic, sixpence_"
  as an anagram of the standard library identifier `atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit`.

If you missed the first game, don't fret: It turns out I still have a whole
second set of questions, so you will probably have another chance Thursday night
after the lightning talks. We have not actually Schedded this as of this writing,
but, assuming the room is unlocked and we get a quorum of players, it'll be
in the same bat place, later bat time — namely, in Summit 1 whenever the lightning talks
have finished up.

As usual, if you'd like a copy of this year's question set
for use with your local user group, send me an email with one round —
10 pub quiz questions — of your own making, and I'll send you the complete
ten-round question set that I used at CppCon 2021.

The other day, prompted by someone's question on SciFi StackExchange, I tracked
down Anthony Boucher's short story "Q.U.R." It first appeared in
the March 1943 _Astounding Science Fiction_, but today you can find
it in [_The Compleat Boucher_](https://amzn.to/2JCqvZA) (2013).

The title of "Q.U.R." is a reference to _R.U.R._,
[Karel Čapek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek)'s play about
"Rossum's Universal Robots." (Čapek was previously seen on this blog in
relation to [_The War With the Newts_](/blog/2019/07/19/blog-roundup/#war-with-the-newts-karel-apek-19).)
In this particular futuristic universe, "universal robots" are all there are;
the word "robot" is de facto synonymous with "android." But these android robots'
universality is wasted on their repetitive jobs. Outside-the-box thinker Quinby
gets a job repairing these robots — the robot elevator operator with an atrophied
and trembling left hand, the robot space-traffic controller with paralysis of the legs,
the robot cook insecure about his insufficiently jointed arms, the robot cryptanalyst
who developed glossolalia just to exercise his vocal unit.

Quinby's robots are not "uniform" but "usuform" — formed following function — and thus
not android at all. The story being set in an
[Asimov](https://friendsofatticus.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/i-robot-by-isaac-asimov/)-esque
universe where "robot" is practically a synonym for "android," the reactions to Quinby's
productions range from skepticism to visceral disgust.

Which brings me to what I guess I liked most about Boucher's story (and its sequel, "Robinc"):
the masterful worldbuilding, delivered with just the right blend of humor and good-naturedness.
Little things like how the space-traffic controller's desk has for communication purposes
both a mike _and_ an ike. (It wasn't until re-reading that I noticed several subtler references
to having one's image picked up on an ike.) And big things like the B-plot that gets the narrator
introduced to Quinby in the first place:

> "What I don't see is why Venusians. We we act that way about them, I mean.
> After all, they're more or less like us. They're featherless bipeds, more or less
> on our general model. And we treat them like they weren't even beings.
> While Martians are a different shape of life altogether, but we don't have ghettos
> for them, or Martian-baiting."

So far I've liked every story I've read in [_The Compleat Boucher_](https://amzn.to/2JCqvZA).
Although I found the character motivations in "The Quest for Saint Aquin" a bit hard to grasp,
I enjoyed its equally great worldbuilding; it made me a bit homesick for the Bay Area.
"Nellthu" and "Khartoum: A Prose Limerick" are witty, elegant, utterly un-PC vignettes.
And "Rappaccini's Other Daughter" — only two pages long — has the most thrilling first
sentence of the year:

> For of course that sinister Paduan precursor of Mad Scientists, whose story
> has been so ably if incompletely [related](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/english/f1124y-001/resources/Rappaccinis_Daughter.pdf)
> by Mr. Hawthorne, was, though mad, enough of a scientist to keep a control.

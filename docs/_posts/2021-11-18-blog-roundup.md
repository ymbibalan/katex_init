At CppCon this year, [Ben Deane](https://cpp.chat/guests/ben_deane/)'s
nametag featured a cryptic crossword clue: _Bird chewing a pencil (7)._
That got us talking about crosswords, which reminded me that a few
months earlier I'd learned of Vermont poet [Holly Painter](http://www.hollypainter.com/),
who has a book coming out next year titled _At last, we listen closely:
cryptic crossword poems_. The publisher's blurb
[explains:](http://www.hollypainter.com/at-last-we-listen-closely-cryptic-crossword-poems/)

> Holly Painter invents an original form: solvable interconnected
> poems [...] Organized into sections such as "Seas & Seasons" and "Characters & Conversations,"
> the collection comprises 55 poem pairs. Each half of the pair – the "clues" poem
> and the “answers” haiku – can be enjoyed as standalone poetry, with subject matter
> ranging from moon-washed forests to pub brawls, rebellious churchwomen to Vermont
> dairy cows. [...] Adventurous readers can choose to join the poet in her work
> by obscuring the haiku and generating it themselves: each line of the "clues"
> poem employs the devices and tricks of cryptic crossword setters to provide
> one word of the "answers" haiku.

I liked the sample I read, a lot. But I'm always so eager to read ahead
that I'm afraid I failed to join the poet in her work. Maybe if I just quote
the "clues" poem, and let the adventurous reader work out the haiku (or just
google it)...

> "Cryptic Crossword L"

> crescent dream.  
> Hush! Inescapable veil reveals shimmers:

> Look, child! Dizzying crown  
> bends, one might say, and sprays  
> lush spots of light everywhere, airy, fine yellow  
> mists. Earth holds you, small,
>
> radiant. Be just,  
> dwelling on good, content in status,  
> content to fly like  
> fledglings, last feather parting tender space.

I'm reading the _Bhagavad Gita_ for the second time,
having done it for a meetup earlier this year and having just joined
a second meetup. This time, I was motivated to find out more of
what happens before and afterwards in the _Mahabharata_ (the much
larger work of which the _Gita_ is a small part).
I highly enjoyed, and very highly recommend,
Peter Brook's epic 1989 miniseries
[_The Mahabharata_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mahabharata_(1989_film)).
It seems to come in several different lengths/cuts; you can
find the 5.5-hour version I watched
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEDO3dlU8U8).
It's divided (by titles and credits) into three
roughly-two-hour segments. If you're looking for
the _Gita_ portion specifically, I recommend watching some
of the beginning (3m–7m) for context, and then
3h14m–3h28m for the _Gita_, and then 5h08m–5h09m
for the recap. If the beginning hooks you and you end up
watching the entire thing in one sitting, you will not have
lost.

Brook's movie is great in many ways, but I found it
particularly _useful_ in two specific ways: All the characters
introduce themselves by name, so you get to hear all the names
pronounced out loud. And Brook cast actors of all different races,
so you generally get a nice broad visual cue to match a face to a name
("Drona is [the Japanese one](https://www.yoshioida.com/),
Bhishma is [the skinny black one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotigui_Kouyat%C3%A9)")
even if you haven't figured out yet what their distinct role in
the story is going to be. (Sadly the exception is
that Arjuna, Yudhisthira, and Duryodhana are all generic
white guys, and so it _did_ take me a good hour into the movie
to sort out which of them was which.)

Finally (via Hacker News), I recommend Nathan J. Robinson's essay
["How Billionaires See Themselves"](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/how-billionaires-see-themselves)
(_Current Affairs_, January 2021). It's a long read, but a fun read,
especially if, like me, you'll probably never read a
billionaire's autobiography for fun. (Nor, sadly, write one.)

> If there is a central recurring theme to [these autobiographies],
> it is this: an insistence that what has made the billionaire rich
> is helping other people rather than helping themselves. The billionaire
> wants to explain to us that what might look like the steady hoarding
> of wealth and a feudalistic imbalance of power is, in fact, the product
> of defensible moral choices and a fair system. [...]
>
> Christianity has elaborate "theodicies": attempts to [reconcile]
> the existence of God with the
> fact that the world is clearly unfair, since the most obvious other option
> is atheism. The rich have their own theodicies: attempts to account
> for the obvious unfairness of their own position and to find some
> explanation for the world being the way it is, because the most
> obvious other option is socialism.

I also found it refreshing to get halfway through the essay and find:

> In the early 1990s there was a bidding war for Janet Jackson,
> whose next album was widely expected to be a sure-fire hit.
> [Virgin Records' Richard Branson] won the war, put out Jackson's album,

> Jackson was hugely popular, and _someone_ was going to put out her next album.
> Branson did not actually add any value. Nothing happened because of him,

I'd never considered the concept of public recording studios,
let alone expect it to pop up offhand like that. Crazy idea?
Probably, yes. But also a refreshing splash-in-the-face that
doesn't feel at all like the _New York Times_.

And if you're wondering what ever happened to the writing staff
at the "real" newspapers, well, check out McKay Coppins'
[_Atlantic_ cover story](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/alden-global-capital-killing-americas-newspapers/620171/)

If you're working out Holly Painter's poem and need a clue:
I think it's useful to know that the _number of letters_ in
each answer (each word of the haiku, clued by each line of the poem)
are: 6-4-6-4; 2-7-6-5-6; 6-6-2-5.

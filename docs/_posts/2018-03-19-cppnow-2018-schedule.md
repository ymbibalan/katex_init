[The schedule for C++Now 2018 has been announced!](http://cppnow.org/announcements/2018/03/2018-program-announced/)

I'm giving two talks this year. On Monday afternoon,
["An Allocator is a Handle to a Heap"](https://cppnow2018.sched.com/event/EC6y/an-allocator-is-a-handle-to-a-heap);
bright and early Tuesday morning,
["The Best Type Traits That C++ Doesn't Have."](https://cppnow2018.sched.com/event/EC77/the-best-type-traits-that-c-doesnt-have)

(Stop clickbait: Those type traits are `is_trivially_relocatable_v<T>`,
[`is_trivially_comparable_v<T>`](/blog/2018/03/19/p0732r0-and-trivially-comparable/),
and `tombstone_traits<T>`.)

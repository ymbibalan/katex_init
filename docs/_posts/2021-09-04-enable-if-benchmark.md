A lot of templates in the C++ standard library are specified with _Constraints:_ elements,
which means that the library vendor must ensure that they drop out of overload resolution
when their constraints are not met — but the Standard does not mandate any particular
mechanism by which the vendor must implement that dropping-out. Two possible mechanisms are
SFINAE using `std::enable_if`, and adding C++20 constraints using the `requires` keyword.

libc++ used to use `std::enable_if` all over the place; but back in 2019 Eric Fiselier
switched libc++ from the standard `enable_if` to a slightly different technique:

    template<bool B> struct _MetaBase {};
    template<bool B> struct _MetaBase<true> {
        template<class T> using _Type = T;
    };
    template<bool B, class T = void>
    using _EnableIf = typename _MetaBase<B>::template _Type<T>;

Notice that the standard `enable_if_t` instantiates a brand-new struct type `enable_if<Bn,Tn>`
for each of the different `Tn`s you use it with; whereas `_EnableIf` only ever instantiates
two structs — `_MetaBase<true>` and `_MetaBase<false>`. Everything else is done via type aliases,
which according to the
[Rule of Chiel](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6gur2x/the_rule_of_chiel_aka_compiletime_cost_of/)
are supposed to be relatively cheaper.
See ["SCARY metafunctions"](/blog/2018/07/09/scary-metafunctions/) (2018-07-09).

In C++20, it's tempting to start using Concepts `requires`-clauses instead of
any version of `enable_if`. However, are `requires`-clauses any faster than the old way?
And was that `_EnableIf` rewrite actually providing any performance benefit? I decided to find out.

The average C++ program doesn't mess around with constrained templates nearly enough to register
on a compile-time benchmark, so I wrote a Python script ([here](/blog/code/2021-09-04-benchmark.py))
to generate translation units that stress `enable_if` in particular. I'd previously done something
similar for ["Don't blindly prefer `emplace_back` to `push_back`"](/blog/2021/03/03/push-back-emplace-back/#the-benchmark-program)
(2021-03-03).

My generator produces translation units that look like this:

    template<int N> requires (N==0) auto f(priority_tag<0>) -> A<0>;
    template<int N> requires (N==1) auto f(priority_tag<1>) -> A<1>;
    template<int N> requires (N==2) auto f(priority_tag<2>) -> A<2>;
    void test() {
        f<0>(priority_tag<3>{});
        f<1>(priority_tag<3>{});
        f<2>(priority_tag<3>{});
    }

except that it varies the number of overloads. (Shown: N=3. The actual number of overloads
in my benchmark varied from N=15 up to N=410.) The generator also varies the style of
SFINAE in four ways:

    template<int N> requires (N==42)
    auto f(priority_tag<42>) -> A<42>;

    template<int N>
    auto f(priority_tag<42>) -> enable_if_t<N==42, A<42>>;

    template<int N, class = enable_if_t<N==42>>
    auto f(priority_tag<42>) -> A<42>;

    template<int N, enable_if_t<N==42, int> = 0>
    auto f(priority_tag<42>) -> A<42>;

For the three non-`requires` versions, we have two different options for how to
implement `enable_if_t`: the standard way via `enable_if<B,T>::type`,
and the SCARY way via `_MetaBase<B>::_Type<T>`. And for each of _those_ we
have one more choice: Do we use the primary template for `B=false`
and make a custom specialization for `B=true`, or vice versa?

So that gives us 13 different ways to implement our SFINAE. Let's time the
compilation of each of these translation units and see if any particular way
outperforms the others.

## Benchmark results

Here's Clang trunk (the future Clang 14), running on my MacBook. The best-fit
curves shown here are quartics, and it's pretty amazing how exactly they fit the data.

Here's GCC 10.3, running on RHEL 7.1. This data is much noisier, perhaps because the
machine is shared. The best-fit curves here are merely quadratics, because the best-fit
quartics ended up super wiggly.

I don't have the ability to run this benchmark on MSVC, but two intrepid readers
have already sent in their benchmark results! The left graph (from Ilya) shows
MSVC `19.30.30401`. The right graph (from Nick Powell) shows MSVC `19.30.30423`.

Again I'm amazed how precisely these two sets of curves, generated on different machines,
match up. Notice that the individual data points are in different places: my script adds some
random "jiggle" to the number of overloads so the results don't end up as a series of illegible
vertical streaks. Also, Ilya's numbers come from a Core i7 and Nick's from a Ryzen 5800x; thus
the Y-axis timings are slightly different. And yet the shapes of the best-fit curves are
pretty much identical between the two graphs!

I observe the following:

* On Clang, C++20 `requires` is significantly _worse_ than the rest.

* On GCC 10.3, the extra-value-parameter method is significantly _better_ than the rest.

* On MSVC, the extra-type-parameter method seems _worse_ than the other two SFINAE methods,
    and C++20 `requires` seems to be operating on a different polynomial from the rest.

I have no particular explanation for any of these observations.

I should emphasize that these results pertain to a benchmark where
_all it does_ is compute candidate sets, on overload sets with tens to hundreds of non-viable
candidates. Real-world C++ code doesn't do this. (Code that uses `<<` for output can definitely
run into hundred-candidate overload sets, but even there, we're not eliminating them via SFINAE.)
So while I hope this benchmark is a cause for mild agitation among C++20 compiler implementors,
in the average C++ codebase I don't think it indicates any need to avoid `requires` or even
to prefer one kind of SFINAE over another.

To run the benchmark on your own machine, get my Python script [here](/blog/code/2021-09-04-benchmark.py).

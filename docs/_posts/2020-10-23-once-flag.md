Yesterday I did a followup Q&A session for my CppCon 2020 presentation
"[Back to Basics: Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Ipn7gCOsY)."
(These followup sessions aren't recorded.) During the Q&A, there was some discussion
of `std::once_flag`. Let's repeat my table of the three C++11 synchronization
primitives (which was briefly flashed as
[slide 34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Ipn7gCOsY&t=42m54s) in the recorded talk,
but I was running behind at that point and didn't stop to discuss it):

|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| `mutex`               | `condition_variable`  | `once_flag`           |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| `lock` blocks only if someone "owns" the mutex. | `wait` always blocks. | `call_once` blocks only if the "done" flag isn't yet set. |
| Many threads can queue up on `lock`. | Many threads can queue up on `wait`. | Many threads can queue up on `call_once`. |
| Calling `unlock` unblocks exactly one waiter: the new "owner." | Calling `notify_one` unblocks exactly one waiter. | Failing at the callback unblocks exactly one waiter: the new "owner." |
|  | Calling `notify_all` unblocks all waiters. | Succeeding at the callback unblocks all waiters and sets the "done" flag. |

Now, the weird thing about `once_flag` is that its sole method, `call_once`, is
not implemented as a C++ member function; it's implemented as a free function
that takes its "`this` parameter" explicitly.
If you've seen me speak on synchronization primitives before, you know
I think this is a super weird glitch in the C++11 concurrency API.

Are you surprised at the complexity of the third column there? A lot of people
think of `once_flag` as a simple primitive. (Or perhaps I should say, they think
of `call_once` as a simple primitive, and don't even realize that the proper object of
our attention is `once_flag` itself!) My mental model of `once_flag` took a while
to develop. Here's how I think of it now:


## `once_flag` is a glass hill

[![The Princess on the Glass Hill, illustrated by Henry Justice Ford](/blog/images/2020-10-23-glass-hill.png)](https://books.google.com/books?id=T14ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA338){: .float-right}
Andrew Lang's _Blue Fairy Book_ tells the story of "The Princess on the Glass Hill."

> Close to the King's palace there was a high, high hill of glass,
> slippery as ice. Upon the very top of this sat the King's daughter
> with three golden apples in her lap, and the man who could ride up
> and take the three golden apples should marry her and have
> half the kingdom.

Ignore the apples. They're not part of this metaphor.

The important thing is that we've set a _task_ to be accomplished;
and in fact it can be accomplished by only one individual (you can't
have _two_ knights marrying the princess!); and, importantly, it
is also possible for an individual to fail at the task.

And so we end up with a line of knights at the base of the hill,
each one waiting his turn to try the challenge. One knight tries
the hill at a time; if he slides back down, he goes home in disgrace
and the next one tries.
(If, having failed once, a knight wants to come back the next day
and try again, that's totally fine.)

As soon as one knight succeeds, he marries the princess and everyone
else can go on about their business.

This being C++, our "task" is expressed as a function (or a lambda,
which is the same thing); and "success" means executing the function
all the way to completion. "Failure" means that the function didn't
complete because it threw an exception. Throwing an exception is the
_only_ way to "fail," as far as `once_flag` is concerned.

In code, our metaphor looks something like this:

    struct Princess {};

    Princess getPrincess(int id) {
        if (std::random_device()() % 10) {
            print("Knight ", id, " has slid back down the hill!\n");
            throw std::runtime_error("failed");
        }
        return Princess{};
    }

    void goQuesting(int id, std::once_flag& hill) {
        std::optional<Princess> wife;
        print("Knight ", id, " has arrived at the foot of the hill.\n");
    try_again:
        try {
            std::call_once(hill, [&]() {
                print("Knight ", id, " is riding up the hill.\n");
                wife = getPrincess(id);
                print("Knight ", id, " has won the princess!\n");
            });
        } catch (...) {
            print("Knight ", id, " is ready to try again.\n");
            goto try_again;
        }
        print("Knight ", id, " has gone home ", (wife ? "with" : "without"), " a wife.\n");
    }

    int main() {
        std::vector<std::thread> knights;
        std::once_flag hill;
        for (int id=0; id < 4; ++id) {
            knights.emplace_back([id, &hill]() {
                goQuesting(id, hill);
            });
        }
        for (auto&& t : knights) t.join();
    }

Godbolt Compiler Explorer can't run multithreaded code as of this writing,
but [here](https://godbolt.org/z/85Kd1b) is the code on Godbolt, anyway.


## Static initializers are glass hills (with shared objectives)

Reminder: C++11 also introduced "thread-safe static initialization," which means
that static initializer expressions are also glass hills in the same sense as
`once_flag`.

    void goQuesting2(int id, std::once_flag& hill) {
        print("Knight ", id, " has arrived at the foot of the hill.\n");
        static std::optional<Princess> wife = [&]() {
            print("Knight ", id, " is riding up the hill.\n");
            auto p = getPrincess(id);
            print("Knight ", id, " has won the princess!\n");
            return p;
        }();
        print("Knight ", id, " has gone home ", (wife ? "with" : "without"), " a wife.\n");
    }

The difference here is that the `static` local variable is shared by all
callers of `goQuesting2`; so as soon as one knight succeeds at riding up
the glass hill, _all_ remaining knights immediately go home with a wife.
Maybe the knights are all in the service of the same prince, and they're
bringing him his wife; or make up your own story, I don't care.

Anyway, observe that the knights in this case _still_ queue up at the foot
of the hill, and it's possible for N-1 of the threads to be blocked waiting
while some other thread tackles the initialization task.

By the way, if you're using some greenthread-esque programming framework
where blocking any single `std::thread` could cause deadlock, I suppose you
should carefully audit your use of non-`constinit` static initializers.

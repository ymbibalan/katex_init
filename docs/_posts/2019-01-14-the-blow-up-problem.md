The joke above is one of my favorites, in terms of illuminating a common interaction
among technical types. (See also [_Pray, Mister Babbage_](/blog/2018/09/26/pray-mister-babbage/).)
This particular retelling comes from Raymond Smullyan's book
[_What Is the Name of This Book?_](https://amzn.to/2spQ47J) (1978).

We've all by now heard the joke about the tourist who asks how to get to
([Dublin](https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/craic/our-favorite-jokes-from-irelands-favorite-comedian-dave-allen),
or Aberdeen, or Millinocket, or wherever) and the laconic local who replies
"If I were trying to get there, [I wouldn't start from here](http://wiki.c2.com/?WouldntStartFromHere)."
Well, Smullyan had his own version of that one.

> My favorite Vermonter story is about the tourist traveling in Vermont who came across a fork
> in the road. On one road was a sign: "To White River Junction." On the other road was a sign:
> "To White River Junction." The tourist scratched his head in perplexity, spied a Vermont native
> standing at the intersection, went over to him and asked, "Does it make any difference _which_
> road I take?"
>
> The Vermonter replied, "Not to me it doesn't."

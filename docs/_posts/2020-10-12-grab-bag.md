In 2010, artist Blake Fall-Conroy produced a ["Minimum Wage Machine."](https://www.blakefallconroy.com/minimum-wage-machine.html)

The machine was originally programmed to dispense one penny every 4.97 seconds, corresponding to the
US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per 2000-hour year) as of 2009.
A decade later, the federal minimum wage [remains](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history)
$7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year).

If you haven't seen [One Pixel Wealth](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) yet,
take a moment and see it. Serendipitously, the green square at the beginning represents
approximately 69 years' worth of wages at $14,500 per year.

The California Republican Party has admitted
[setting up rogue ballot boxes](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/12/923119170/california-officials-tell-state-gop-to-stop-distributing-ballot-drop-boxes)
and marking them as "official," despite cease-and-desist letters from the California Secretary of State.
It's not clear what the Republicans' plan is, other than to sow confusion.

For an idea of what Republican voter intimidation has looked like in the past, take a look at
the [Ballot Security Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_Security_Task_Force),
a successful effort by the Republican National Committee to suppress the black vote in the
1981 New Jersey gubernatorial race.

> The task force consisted of a group of armed off-duty police officers wearing armbands,
> who were hired to patrol polling sites in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods of Newark and Trenton.
> BSTF patrols challenged and questioned voters at the polls and blocked the way of some prospective voters.

[Roger Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone) served as "chief strategist"
for the Republican gubernatorial candidate Thomas Kean, who ended up winning that race
thanks to the Ballot Security Task Force.
Earlier this year, Roger Stone was convicted of seven felonies stemming from the "Russiagate"
investigation; he was then summarily pardoned by Donald Trump.

Most recently [he's been calling for Trump to declare martial law and

I'll leave the last word to Republican Utah Senator and anti-masker Mike Lee:

Which of these two functions — `foo` or `bar` — do you expect to give better codegen?

    struct Integer {
        int value;
        ~Integer() {} // deliberately non-trivial
    };

    void foo(std::vector<int>& v) {
        v.back() *= 0xDEADBEEF;
        v.pop_back();
    }

    void bar(std::vector<Integer>& v) {
        v.back().value *= 0xDEADBEEF;
        v.pop_back();
    }

[Compile both with GCC and libstdc++.](https://godbolt.org/z/rsx45K)
Did you guess correctly?

    foo:
      movq   8(%rdi), %rax
      imull  $-559038737, -4(%rax), %edx
      subq   $4, %rax
      movl   %edx, (%rax)
      movq   %rax, 8(%rdi)
      ret
    bar:
      subq   $4, 8(%rdi)
      ret

What's going on here is that GCC is smart enough to understand that when you
run a destructor on a piece of memory, you end its lifetime, which renders all
preceding writes to that piece of memory "dead". But GCC is *also* smart enough
to understand that a *trivial* destructor (such as the pseudo-destructor `~int()`)
is a no-op with no effects whatsoever.

So, `bar` calls `pop_back`, which runs `~Integer()`, which marks `vec.back()`
as "dead", and GCC eliminates the multiplication by `0xDEADBEEF` entirely.

On the other hand, `foo` calls `pop_back`, which runs the pseudo-destructor `~int()`
(it might choose to omit the call altogether, but it doesn't). GCC observes that
this is a no-op and forgets about it. Therefore GCC does *not* observe that `vec.back()`
is dead, and *cannot* eliminate the multiplication by `0xDEADBEEF`.

This happens for all trivial destructors, not just for pseudo-destructors like `~int()`.
Replace our `~Integer() {}` with `~Integer() = default;` and watch the `imull` instruction
reappear!

UPDATE, March 2021: Trivially destructible objects' lifetimes are now correctly
ended by pseudo-destructor calls. This was one of the effects of Richard Smith's
[P0593 "Implicit creation of objects for low-level object manipulation,"](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p0593r6.html#7543-destruction-exprprimiddtor)
adopted into C++20 (but implemented by GCC 11 in all language modes, thank goodness).

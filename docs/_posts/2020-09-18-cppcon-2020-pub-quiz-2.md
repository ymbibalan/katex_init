![The return of Anagram Time](/blog/images/2020-09-18-anagram-time-2.jpg){: .float-right}
Last night I emceed Game 2 of CppCon 2020's "C++ Pub Quiz."
This time, six teams participated. Thanks to `std::locale::facet`,
Team SFINAE, `2*Alex`, `auto team;`, `std::make_exceptional_future`,
and our winning team, Team SNPIOR ("Shall Not Participate In Overload Resolution")!

The winning score tonight was _again_ 35 points, despite being a completely different
set of questions. My favorite round was the brainstorm round:

> The C++20 standard's "Index of Library Names" lists 14 identifiers
> beginning with “`set_`” [SAY: “ess ee tee underscore”] which have special meaning
> to the standard library. Name as many of these identifiers as you can. Your score
> for this round will be the number of identifiers you name correctly, minus the
> number you name incorrectly (if any). Here's a hint: Six are member functions,
> four are function templates, three are free functions, one is a zombie name,
> and one is new in C++20.

Scores for that round ranged from 9 down to −3.

We also had a "lightning round" in which the topic was, "Does this `using`-directive
permit me to use the user-defined literal `42ms` or not?" No team scored above 6 out of 10
in this round. Here's an interesting data point: _None_ of our six teams, with the
combined powers of about 30 C++ programmers among them, believed that a simple
[`using namespace std;`](https://godbolt.org/z/6j35e3)
would grant access to the `42ms` literals.

A couple of people have already asked me if I'll send them the whole question set
for use at their local user group. I'm offering the same deal as I did last year:
Send me an email with one round — 10 pub quiz questions — of your own making, and
I'll send you the complete ten-round question set that I used at CppCon 2020.

So I guess all the cool kids are writing coronavirus-quarantine-themed musical parodies?
Here's my contribution.

> Hello muddah / hello faddah,  
> Here I am just / doing nada,  
> How it ends I've / not the foggiest.  
> But they say maybe we'll go outside by August.  
>
> The econo / my's in slow-mo,  
> Thanks to Governor / Andrew Cuomo.  
> If we're essential / they can't fire us;  
> That's consolation when we catch coronavirus.  
>
> Wash your hands for / count of twenty.  
> That kills virus / evidently.  
> And remember / sanitizer.  
> Just be glad you're not a nurse who works for [Kaiser](https://www.modbee.com/news/local/article241633561.html)!  
>
> No more classrooms / no more schoolbooks,  
> There's a whole new / set of rulebooks:  
> At-home teachers / teach their class words;  
> They use [Zoom](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1244997990382596096) so now the Chinese have their passwords.  
>
> Fewer cars has / had a major  
> Good effect on / Mother Nature.  
> Streams are clearer. / Skies are bluer.  
> Alligators are returning to the sewer.  
>
> Just stay home / oh muddah faddah,  
> Just stay home / do what you gaddah,  
> Don't — take — trips —  
> Out in the city where / you might / get cited by the mayor.  
> Just stay home / Don't catch corona,  
> Just stay home / and be a loner,  
> Watch — Net— flix —  
> Oh please don't go outside / Okay / At least I tried...  
>
> This pandemic / needs our quelling  
> Quarantining / in our dwelling.  
> Social distance / most intently  
> And we'll lick it just in time for COVID-20!

This all started when I was trying to get to sleep the other night, and Verse 3, Athena-like,
popped fully formed into my head and just _would not leave_ until I'd written it down.

[I've recorded a version for YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7R3H_67SWw).
However, I know I can't do it justice — I'm no triple threat, I can't play the piano,
I don't even own a [propeller beanie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFTOvO0utY) —
and so I place these lyrics in the public domain. If you record your own version, send me a link!

Finally, here's a few of my favorite coronavirus filk songs so far:

- Daniel Matarazzo's ["Super Bad Transmittable Contagious Awful Virus"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykieEE1j9eA)

- Claire and Mel Vatz's ["We're All Home Bound"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ci5EYb9qA)

- Eliza Rubenstein's ["I am the very model of effective social distancing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ha6nR9REA) (performed here by NYGASP, with additional lyrics by James Mills)

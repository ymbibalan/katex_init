Today I learned (from the Reader's Digest–published [_American Folklore and Legend_](https://amzn.to/2REUGVw))
that the state of California was [named after a fictional island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_California).

> California was the name given to a mythical island [...] in the popular
> early 16th-century romance novel _Las Sergas de Esplandián_, by Spanish author
> [Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garci_Rodr%C3%ADguez_de_Montalvo).

> Know, then, that an island called California exists on the right hand of the Indies,
> very close to the coast of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it was peopled by black women,
> without any man existing there, because they lived in the manner of the Amazons.
> They were of beautiful and robust body, ardent valor, and great strength.
> Their island was the strongest in all the world, with its steep cliffs and rocky shores.
> Their weapons were all of gold, and of the same metal were the harnesses of the savage beasts
> that they were accustomed to tame and ride, because in all the island there was no other metal
> than gold.

Of course Baja California turned out not to be an island after all, but a peninsula.

A little later in the same book, in a story about Jean Lafitte, I was reminded that New Orleans'
[Barataria Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barataria_Bay) is named for another fictional island,
the island of Barataria governed by Sancho Panza in [_Don Quixote_](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/996).

> "And where is this island?" said Ricote.
>
> "Where?" said Sancho; "two leagues from here, and it is called the island of Barataria."
>
> "Nonsense! Sancho," said Ricote; "islands are away out in the sea; there are no islands on the mainland."

This is not to be confused with the Kingdom of Barataria from
[_The Gondoliers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gondoliers) (1889).

Wikipedia claims that Edward Everett Hale (who published a translation of some of _Esplandián_
[in the _Atlantic Monthly_ in 1864](https://books.google.com/books?id=t941AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA265))
linked the name "California" and the name of the island's queen "Calafia" to the word
[_Caliph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate); that is, "Calafia" as female caliph
and "California" as Amazonian caliphate.

[_Asimov's Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan_](https://amzn.to/2CUbtfe) links the name "Barataria"
to the Spanish [_barato_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/barato#Spanish), "cheap" (etymologically
related to our verb _to barter_).

So now you know: one fictional island that gave its name to a real island that turned out not to
be an island at all, and one fictional island that turned out not to be an island and then
gave its name to a real body of water.

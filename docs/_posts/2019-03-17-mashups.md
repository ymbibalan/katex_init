First of all, [happy St. Patrick's Day!](/blog/2018/03/17/what-you-did-with-all-the-snakes/)
I guess that means this blog has been around for a year already. That definitely snuck up on me.

I'm glad these pop music mashups exist:

- [Green Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU9JoFKlaZ0&t=1m43s) x [The Eagles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PTEqZURh4o): ["Greenday Massacre"](https://soundcloud.com/dean-gray/09-dean-gray-greenday-massacre) (and honestly everything else on the [_Dean Gray_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-sHkc1zxLk&index=1&list=PLrpOJGxlgJwIEs9i9a0UjNs6iSS0QomI-) album)

- [The Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T1c7GkzRQQ) x [The Bee Gees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JoZS6LgqYI): ["Roxanne Should Be Dancing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kMHL8PW-EM)

I offer the following concepts to the world in the hope that the world will make them happen.

- [Placebo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHQngnnHE_0) x [Butthole Surfers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8sGmSEehi4): "A Friend in Need is Pepper"

- [Willie Nelson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XyRdJr4LSc) x [Culture Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmcA9LIIXWw) (ft. [Jerry Reed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgUaFkpS3Y)): "Karma of New Orleans"

Also, when is [Jon Sudano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iypeAdXy9QE) going to release
a vocal cover of [Meredith Brooks' "Bitch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivt_N2Zcts) already?

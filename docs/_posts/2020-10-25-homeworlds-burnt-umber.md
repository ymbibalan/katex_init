Here's another [Binary Homeworlds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14634/homeworlds) puzzle.
I posted it to BoardGameGeek back in early September, but might as well record it here too.

For details of how I created the puzzle, and how I created the image (thanks to Sleafar on Puzzling
StackExchange!), see [the first post in this series](/blog/2020/05/29/homeworlds-mini-doomsday-machine/).

According to Looney Labs' website, the Pyramid Quartet standalone Homeworlds set goes on sale
November 12. You can [preorder it from Looney Labs!](http://store.looneylabs.com/Homeworlds)


## The puzzle

Consider the following position in a game of Binary Homeworlds (using the Pyramid Quartet rules).

![A graphical representation of the game state.](/blog/images/2020-10-25-burnt-umber.png)

    Lee (0,r1b2) r2b1b2-r1g2
    Ray (1,r2) g1g1-r3r3g3
    DS1 (g3) -b1
    DS2 (y2) r1y1g1b2-
    DS3 (y1) y1-y3b1

The stash contains `r2r3 y2y2y3y3 g2g2g3 b3b3b3`. It is Lee's turn to move.

Notice that Lee is currently in check: If Lee passes, Ray can simply sac r3 to capture b1b2r2 at Lee
and win the game.

*What is Lee's single best move at this point, and why?*

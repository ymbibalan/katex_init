From Joris-Karl Huysmans' [_À rebours_](http://www.huysmans.org/against/agvii.htm) (1884),
which I highly recommend to anyone with a decadent literary bent.
This morning our protagonist has just received a shipment of exotic plants:

My lovely wife and I bought a _Nepenthes_ pitcher plant at the
[Pacific Orchid Exposition](http://www.orchidsanfrancisco.org/orchid-events/pacific-orchid-expo-poe/)
in Golden Gate Park this past February. When we traveled across the country in October,
we brought it almost all the way with us — but the freezing temperatures in South Dakota
did not suit it, and by the time we got to New Jersey, it was in terminal decline.

But look what she got me for Christmas!

Incidentally, the translator rendered Huysmans' "_pain de [Chester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester)_"
as "Cheshire cheese."
I can't find any definition online for _pain de Chester_, nor any indication that
[Cheshire cheese's traditional shape](https://culturecheesemag.com/cheese-library/cheshire-applebys)
resembled the round shape of a cycad. (Edam, on the other hand...) So I wonder what the deal is
with that.

Huysmans also seems to have conflated the [Venus fly*trap*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_flytrap)
(_attrape-mouche_) — which is native to a shockingly small area of mainland North America —
with the native Antillean [fly*catcher*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant_flycatcher)
(_gobe-mouche_). The latter is not a plant at all; it's a bird! Plantwise, the Antilles are home
only to toothless [_Pinguicula_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinguicula) and some less impressive
members of the [Lentibulariaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentibulariaceae).

The flytrap belongs to the genus _Dionaea_, which reminds me that scary hypertext fiction
["The Dionaea House"](http://web.archive.org/web/20120419155009/http://www.dionaea-house.com:80/default.htm)
is worth sharing. The domain name where it originally appeared has lapsed now, but fortunately
the Internet Archive's
Wayback Machine is on the job. (Have you made all your [donations](https://archive.org/donate/)
for this holiday season yet?)

The author of "The Dionaea House," Eric Heisserer, went on to a Hollywood screenwriting career.
His adaptation of _Bird Box_, starring Sandra Bullock, hit Netflix on December 21.

A few weeks ago, I read René Daumal's [_A Night of Serious Drinking_](https://archive.org/details/nightofseriousd000daum/)
(published as _La grande beuverie_ 1938; translated by David Coward and E.A. Lovatt 1979). I recommend it;
it's a fun and erudite satire — sort of a less political _Gulliver's Travels_ or a less bitter
[_Jurgen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurgen,_A_Comedy_of_Justice). At times it made me think,
"This is clearly an allegory... but of what?" and at other times "Is he satirizing _bad_ scientists, _bad_ writers,
_bad_ artists? or _all_ scientists, _all_ writers, _all_ artists?"

Our narrator is being escorted, like Dante, through a series of nested realms
in which he encounters various types of preoccupied persons:

> [The orderly and I were] now in the midst of the canvas-colorers
> [...] My companion called up a large man dressed like a Spaniard
> and asked him why he painted.
>
> "Me?" he said. "I'll tell you: I paint a pear, say. When you have a desire
> to eat the pear, I'll be happy."
>
> The orderly summarized: "To give his fellow man a desire without giving
> him the means to satisfy it." And then he questioned another, a portly
> red-faced man with a blond beard who declared:
>
> "The way I see it, it's very simple. I stand in front of my canvas
> [which he was], I look at my apple or cloud, pick up my brush,
> I select a scarlet [which he did], fling some just _there_ [he almost
> poked a hole through the canvas], and I exult [he exulted visibly].
> I look at my scarlet and then at my courgette or sea-perch; I select
> a green, bung it just _there_ [he laid about him for all he was worth],
> and I exult [here he exulted again]..."
>
> We moved on to a third man, who was small and squat with ginger hair,
> who gave this reply:
>
> "To claim to imitate nature is first vulgar and second sacrilegious;
> but most of all it is to attempt the impossible. [...] To my mind,
> painting means pressing form and color directly into the service of
> a freely constructive thought. It means making geometry sing, abstracting
> the abstract from its own abstraction [...]"
>
> "It's this," the orderly explained, and showed me shapes traced
> out with ruler and compass and shaded in with flat colors.
>
> "And it's very dull," he added.

Finally our narrator makes his way to Olympus, where a cleverly designed aperture
in the floor lets in the smoke of sacrifices from the world below
"as in [Lucian's description](http://lucianofsamosata.info/wiki/doku.php?id=home:texts_and_library:dialogues:icaromenippus)."
The gods of Olympus are occupied in designing the latest intellectual fashions:

> The god of language inhaled the vapors of a punch that was being
> prepared below in his honor, and familiarly thumped the Primescienter
> on the shoulder.
>
> "Well now, my dear fellow," he said. "Ouroborism is henceforth in fashion.
> What are you doing about it in your area?"
>
> "We have already put it into practice," said the other. "For instance,
> we explain that the cow is herbivorous because
> [otherwise it would not be a cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle);
> that the Earth revolves around the Sun because the latter occupies one
> of the foci of the ellipse annually described by the former; that man
> seeks happiness because he is endowed with positive eudaemonotropism;
> that ice floats on water because of its lower density."

(My thoughts as I read this: _Ha, good one. Ha, good one. Ha, good one. How dare you._)
The Primescienter continues:

> "Quite recently, one of our Scienters has promoted the 'operational concept,'
> which is, he says, a concept identical with the operation one must carry
> out in conceiving it; in the same way, the concept of a measure is
> identical with the operation of measuring. Nobody is more ouroboristic
> than we are, you see."

I was not so surprised to find out that "[operationalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/operationalism/)"
was in fact a real thing, stemming from the work of P.W. Bridgman circa 1927.
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy writes:

> [Bridgman] was both fascinated and troubled by the fact that
> "essential physical limitations" forced scientists to use different
> measurement operations for the same concept in different domains of phenomena.

We take it for granted these days that the operation of "holding up a ruler against
an object in the same room" measures the same _kind_ of length or distance as
"measuring the parallax of a nearby star against the stellar background." But
there's no particular reason we should take that for granted _a priori_, is there?
Bridgman, 1927:

> To say that a certain star is 10<sup>5</sup> light years distant is
> actually and conceptually an entire different kind of thing from saying
> that a certain goal post is 100 meters distant. [...]
> If we have more than one set of operations, we have more than one concept,
> and strictly there should be a separate name to correspond to each different set of operations.

Besides distance and velocity, consider temperature. The Stanford Encyclopedia entry
on operationalism happens to have been written by [Hasok Chang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasok_Chang),
who literally wrote the book on the history of temperature measurement.
([_Inventing Temperature_](https://amzn.to/34QYlEI), 2004. I haven't read more than
the preface, but it sounds fascinating.) Chang invites us to consider

> the efforts of the English potter [Josiah Wedgwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Wedgwood) (1730–1795)
> to extend the temperature scale to cover the very high temperatures in his kilns, at which mercury vaporized
> and glass melted. All previously known thermometers failed in that pyrometric range, so Wedgwood felt obliged
> to invent a whole new measurement standard. Wedgwood noticed that very high temperatures made pieces of
> clay shrink, and created a temperature scale by assuming that the amount of contraction was proportional
> to temperature beyond “red heat” (defined as 0). As the start of his scale was already beyond
> the boiling point of mercury, Wedgwood’s scale was wholly disconnected from the temperature scale
> defined by mercury thermometers. Later, in response to widespread demand to clarify the meaning of
> his scale in more usual terms, Wedgwood made a translation of his scale into Fahrenheit degrees,
> by means of an intermediate scale which overlapped with the high end
> of the mercury scale and the low end of the clay scale. This procedure produced some unlikely numbers —
> for example, 21,877°F for the temperature of his air-furnace.
>
> It seems that Wedgwood initially did exactly what operationalist conscience would dictate:
> as the new instrument did not operate in the range of any trustworthy previous thermometers,
> he made a fresh scale. [...]
> Why did everyone, including Wedgwood himself, feel compelled to interpret the Wedgwood clay scale
> in terms of the Fahrenheit mercury scale?

At one point, as sometimes happens, I almost forgot I was reading about science and not about C++.

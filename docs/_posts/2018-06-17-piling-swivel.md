Back when the Mixpanel lit club read _East of Eden_ (which is amazingly good, by the way),
we got to the part where Adam is in the Army —

> Adam spent his next five years doing the things an army uses to keep its men from going
> insane—endless polishing of metal and leather, parade and drill and escort, ceremony of
> bugle and flag, a ballet of business for men who aren’t doing anything

— and it reminded me of Henry Reed's 1942 poem "Naming of Parts":

> To-day we have naming of parts. Yesterday,  
> We had daily cleaning. And to-morrow morning,  
> We shall have what to do after firing. But to-day,  
> To-day we have naming of parts. Japonica  
> Glistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,  
> &nbsp; And to-day we have naming of parts.

[The full poem, annotated, is here](http://www.solearabiantree.net/namingofparts/namingofparts.php);
it includes an annotation explaining what exactly _is_ a "piling swivel" and why the men
have in this case not got one.

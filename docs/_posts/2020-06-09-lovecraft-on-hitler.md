One of my cousins is a Trump voter. We don't talk much in normal life,
but we recently had what I would call a cordial debate via email.
Here are some of his comments on Trump:

> Yes, Trump bothers me with some erratic comments and an inflated ego, but I feel fairly certain
> the good of the Country is where his heart is seated. Much is at stake in this next election.
> Perhaps the most important election of our lives.

Again:

> Trump is the result of politics as usual. Trump is not a politician, he is a business man.
> He was duly elected in 2016. The Electoral College was set up by our
> founding Fathers to give voice to entire nation, not just the cities and towns. Both parties
> are afraid of Trump, he is owned by no one. Special interest groups and lobbyists have little
> or no control over him. What a refreshing concept! Trump is not a polished speaker, though
> highly educated. His message is from the heart not necessarily through careful thought.
> He is abrasive and has trouble winning over new followers because of his comments and style.

(Here end the quotes from my cousin. Everything below is quoting _other_ people about _other_ things.)

During our exchange I ran across
[a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/4wmk6k/lovecraft_on_hitler_1933/)
containing an excerpt from the prodigious correspondence of
[H.P. Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft) (1890–1937),
which snippet struck me as having a weirdly familiar tone. Unfortunately, that Reddit post omitted
an entire line of text from the middle of (what is here) the first sentence, and had a few
other typos besides... so I ordered a copy of Lovecraft's collected letters ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/30qy5Ab))
and re-transcribed it fresh. The following snippet comes from a letter to J. Vernon Shea
dated November 8–22, 1933; this specific section is dated November 11.

The editors (S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz) note in their introduction to this collection
that "Lovecraft's muted and conflicted praise of Hitler has not done Lovecraft's reputation
any favors, but [...]"

I tend to disagree with the editors' assessment. It's tempting to look at Lovecraft's lukewarm endorsement
of Hitler and think, "Ah, well, he's not saying the guy is great. He _volunteers_
that the man's got massive flaws." Or, "Ah, he values _honesty_ and _patriotism_ in a leader;
I, also, value these things. We're not so different!" It'd take just a little jolt —
a Nuremberg law, a Kristallnacht, an invasion of Czechoslovakia, a Holocaust —
to turn his lukewarm endorsement ice-cold... right?

This notion is appealing, but misguided. If the best you can say for someone
is that they're "not very keen on Hitler": well, that's weak common ground. If they identify
Hitler as an "honest, ignorant man": they _may not be all that good at identifying
honest men._ If the main flaws they identify in the man are his "scientific addle-patedness & crude gaucheries,"
as opposed to the content of his speech and the content of his actions: well, they
mightn't be as fazed by "the revelations of the Holocaust" as you might hope.

So, in Lovecraft's case, it's important not just to read the stuff that makes him sound
like a reasonable, [middle-of-the-road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance),
Hitler-had-his-flaws kind of guy — but also the stuff like _this_, on the American melting-pot.
From a letter to J. Vernon Shea dated May 29, 1933:

> Altogether too much is made by radical theorists of the foreign immigrant influence.
> It is true that hordes of persons of non-English heritage have
> entered the country — but that has nothing to do with the seated culture of the region.
> These foreigners did not make the nation. They merely flocked in
> later to enjoy what others had made. Our own civilisation was irrevocably
> seated here long before they came, & it would be silly to suppose that we
> shall allow these crumb-snatchers to disturb the foundations which we laid
> for our descendants. They can either conform to the native culture which
> they find, or get the hell out of here. We <b>made</b> this nation, & if any of the
> skulking Jews or Dagoes who crawl after us to eat the fruit we laboriously
> planted think they can dictate to us, they'll soon learn better by means of a
> heavy-shod boot applied to their rear ends. Most of them are only the scum
> & dregs of their own countries, anyhow — the weaklings who couldn't keep
> on top among their own people. We welcome any biologically & culturally
> assimilable newcomers <b>who are willing to abide by our institutions;</b> but if any crawling
> peasants & ghetto bastards expect to troop in here <b>& mould us in their own direction</b>,
> we'll shew them in short order where they get off!

The phrasing in this snippet reminds me of Lovecraft's short story
["The Street"](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/s.aspx),
published thirteen years earlier, in 1920,
of which "The Shadow Over Usenet"
[wrote](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102123619/http://www.angelfire.com/space2/pyrkium/Lovecraft/023_TSOU_The_Street.htm):

> Synopsis:  This is the story of a street, from its humble beginnings
> in colonial times to its final self-destruction in Lovecraft's era.
> At first populated by good English men, the Street is later taken over
> by a band of anarchists who would like to destroy the U. S. A. The
> Street takes supernatural revenge upon them before they can do so,
> however.

I highly recommend [the whole thing](https://onehundredpages.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/dont-make-fun-of-renowned-dan-brown/).
The piece is also still up and googleable on the _Telegraph_ website, but they have lots of video ads
*and* a popup that blocks the page if you're running AdBlock.

Speaking of more ads than content, may I present _D'Ordel's Pantechnicon_,
subtitled _An Universal Directory of the Mechanical Art of Manufacturing Illustrated Magazines;
Intended as a Course of Learning for Future Writers; Containing an Account of the Advance of
Literature in Modern Times; with a Perfect Model for the Guidance of Students; and Directions
Exposing the whole Manual Art of the Trade_, and written — excuse me, "edited" — by Mark Sykes
and Edmund Sandars (1904). 
The "perfect model" referred to in the subtitle is _Scragford's Farthing_, the _very_ model of a
modern literary magazine, which contains such beautiful parody-journalism as the following gripping
excerpt from ["London's Gold-Mines, or a Day Among the Dustmen"](https://books.google.com/books?id=VecaAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA16):

> On the 4th of July, 1853, the seventy-seventh anniversary of the Declaration of the
> Independence of the United States of America, a dustman, whom we will call Robinson,
> was emptying his cart of dust at one of the great dust shoots of the metropolis, now
> long disused and probably covered by recent building. He had had a long and fatiguing
> day at his work, and perhaps may have been more or less anxious to get back to his wife
> and family — if, that is to say, he enjoyed the advantages of matrimonial life and some
> tender olive branches.
>
> As the dust fell from his cart he thought that he saw some object glittering in the evening
> sunlight. He got down from his cart to the ground and walked down the slope of the shoot
> to the spot where he thought, possibly, the object might have fallen. He groped about in
> the refuse with the toe of his boot, which was tipped with iron nails, and soon disclosed
> the bright object which he had really seen. It proved to be a spoon made of Abyssinian gold,
> a composition closely resembling in appearance the real article. He picked it up between
> his fingers and examined it with his eyes. Then he put it in his pocket and walked back
> to his cart. He climbed in...

It really gets worse the closer you look at it. I think my favorite part is where he says
"resembling in appearance."

(The original article is illustrated with copious photographs. Interestingly, the Online Etymology
Dictionary dates the word ["photojournalism"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/photojournalism)
back only as far as 1944, even though the concept is clearly much older.)

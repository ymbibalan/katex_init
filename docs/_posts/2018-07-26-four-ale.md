I'm currently reading [Arthur Machen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Machen)'s
[_The Three Impostors_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Impostors) (1895).
It's a sort of episodic collection of vignettes, nested and interlocked in various
haphazard ways, very similar to the _Arabian Nights_. And not that different from
a modern blog, really.

UPDATED to add: From Machen's use of the term and from Wikipedia, I have learned
that this genre is known as the [Milesian tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milesian_tale):

> a complicated narrative fabric: a travelogue carried by a main narrator with
> numerous subordinate tales [...] incorporate[d] into the main tale through the
> rhetorical technique of <em>narrative impersonation</em>.

Machen's [_The Great God Pan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_God_Pan)
was reportedly a huge influence on H.P. Lovecraft. I can see the similarities, even when
Machen isn't describing "the symbol and presence of all evil and all hideous corruption"
([page 224](https://books.google.com/books?id=moYlAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA224))
but simply our protagonist walking down the street in a morbid mood
([page 247](https://books.google.com/books?id=moYlAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247)):

"Cagmag" meaning "[inferior meat](http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cag1.htm)";
and for "four-ale" (a phrase of which Machen is IMHO _inordinately_ fond)
I turned to Martyn Cornell's excellent essay
["Half-and-half to mother-in-law: a history of beer 1837â€“1914"](http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/123/Beer.pdf).
Among other things, I learned that _porter_ is in fact named for the occupation,
and why you might hear the phrase "a pint of bitter" but never "a bottle of bitter."

If you like Lovecraft or Poe, I recommend Machen; and if you like Machen, I recommend
[_Vathek_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vathek) (William Beckford, 1786).

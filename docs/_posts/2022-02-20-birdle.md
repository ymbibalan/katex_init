From the "committing to the bit" department, I present: [Birdle](https://quuxplusone.github.io/wordle-clone/birdle/).

This was inspired by my having, in one day:

- Rewatched the excellent 2011 comedy [_The Big Year_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Year)
    (featuring the song ["I Like Birds" by Eels](https://youtu.be/HJnbmUnNNYo))

- Listened to _This American Life_'s mildly engrossing
  ["We Need to Talk about Birdly"](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/754/spark-bird/act-three-11)
  (featuring the song ["We're Gonna Live in the Trees" by Robyn Hitchcock](https://youtu.be/T50jTTytPbg))

- Found an actually intelligible Wordle-clone repo on GitHub: Kyle Cook's
  [WebDevSimplified/wordle-clone](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wordle-clone).
  He's got [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Wak7iN4JZzU?ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) walking
  through the design, too.

Players of _[Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan)_, and/or actual birders,
may have a distinct edge here.

As of this writing, there are still some rough edges and loose ends on "Birdle."
Settings (hard mode, night mode) and statistics (streaks, anything having to do with local storage)
are missing; and there are probably some bugs I don't know about yet.
If you find a bug (or better, fix a bug!), please let me know!

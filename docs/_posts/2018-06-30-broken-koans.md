Via [David Chess](http://www.davidchess.com/words/BrokenKoans.html):

> One afternoon a student said,
> "Roshi, I don't really understand what's going on.
> I mean, we sit in zazen and we gasshō to each other and everything,
> and Felicia got enlightened when the bottom fell out of her water-bucket,
> and Todd got enlightened when you popped him one with your staff,
> and people work on koans and get enlightened, but I've been doing
> this for two years now, and the koans don't make any sense, and I
> don't feel enlightened at all! Can you just _tell_ me what's going on?"
>
> "Well, you see," Roshi replied, "for most people, and especially for
> most educated people like you and I, what we perceive and experience
> is heavily mediated, through language and concepts that are deeply
> ingrained in our ways of thinking and feeling. Our objective here
> is to induce in ourselves and in each other a psychological state
> that involves the unmediated experience of the world, because we
> believe that that state has certain desirable properties.
> It's impossible in general to reach that state through any particular
> form or method, since forms and methods are themselves examples of
> the mediators that we are trying to avoid. So we employ a variety of
> ad hoc means — some linguistic like koans and some non-linguistic
> like zazen — in the hope that for any given student one or more of our
> methods will, in whatever way, engender the condition of non-mediated
> experience that is our goal. And since even thinking in terms of
> mediators and goals tends to reinforce our undesirable dependency on
> concepts, we actively discourage exactly this kind of analytical discourse."

> And the student was enlightened.

This afternoon I was watching the 1936 MGM production _Tarzan Escapes_
(starring ex-Olympian [Johnny Weissmuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weissmuller)
and mother-to-Mia-Farrow [Maureen O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Sullivan))
when, in among all the B-roll of African wildlife, I caught a strange interlude
([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB-YCsz51oc)):

!["Gooney bird" running across clearing](/blog/images/2018-03-24-gooney-bird.jpg)

You can tell immediately that this bird-like creature isn't altogether natural.
It's definitely... something... dressed up in a costume. But something about its
swaying gait looks [awfully familiar](https://youtu.be/Il6JesTyYjg?t=25). Is that...
no, it couldn't be...

*Yes!* That *is* Johnny Eck, of _Freaks_ (1932), randomly dressed up in a bird suit
in this _Tarzan_ movie!

[_ERBzine_ issue 0618](http://www.erbzine.com/mag6/0618.html) (that's "ERB" as in
"Edgar Rice Burroughs", of course) explains:

> In almost every one of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, there's a trek up the
> treacherous cliffs that lead to the escarpment [...] Quite often, they use library
> footage, or second-unit sequences to show the local wildlife. There's a lot of
> recycling in these films, with action scenes and shots of Tarzan swinging through
> the trees (performed by a trapeze artist in some cases) appearing repeatedly. [...]
>
> Yes, the bird is actually a bloke in a costume. Not just any bloke â€”
> that's Johnny Eck, "half-man" sensational star of _Freaks_ (1932).
> Having looked up this moment, I was surprised to find that it was itself used in the
> first Weissmuller Tarzan film, _Tarzan the Ape Man_ (1932). Had I not noticed it?
> Why did they choose to slip in this surreal moment, dressing up a human actor for
> one of the animals? [...]
>
> I suspect the answer is that they did it because they could. The footage was shot
> during the making of _Freaks_, another MGM production, that would eventually be
> released a month before _Tarzan the Ape Man_ [...]
>
> After _Freaks_, Eck was featured as a bird creature or "Gooney Bird" in three Tarzan
> movies: _Tarzan the Ape Man_ (1932), _Tarzan Escapes_ (1936) and 
> _Tarzan's Secret Treasure_ (1941).

Finally, buried in the middle of the _ERBzine_ article is a funny little story about
Johnny Eck that I'd never known before.

> He and brother Robert travelled the country with magician [Rajah Raboid](https://travsd.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/stars-of-vaudeville-576-rajah-raboid/)'s
> "Miracles of 1937" show, in which they were part of the sawing-in-half illusion.
> The act involved Rob being called out of the audience as a volunteer for a magician's
> trick, and climbing into the box, but it was legless Johnny who emerged from it.
> A midget acting as Johnny's legs would then run offstage, chased by Johnny.

[Trav S.D. adds:](https://travsd.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/stars-of-vaudeville-576-rajah-raboid/)

> By all accounts, this startling act produced screams and fainting.

Catch Johnny Eck in the bird suit when Turner Classic Movies next plays _Tarzan's Secret Treasure_,

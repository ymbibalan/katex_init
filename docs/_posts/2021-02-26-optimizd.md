Hat tip to Lénárd Szolnoki for accidentally working this into an unrelated
Godbolt (by reusing the name `foo` for both the caller-of-the-interesting-bit
and the callee-of-the-interesting-bit). I was _thoroughly_ confused for a
minute there.

By the way, the "stonks" meme template is from
[/r/MemeTemplateOfficial](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/comments/dw6oy1/stonk_meme_template_but_without_the_text/).
Because I just know I'm going to keep finding reasons to use it.

Your Pi Day festivities may have been canceled this year, but get ready to celebrate Tau Day on June 28th!

The [Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto) proposes that we should all consider — and
perhaps teach — the benefits of $$\tau = 6.283185\ldots$$ over that in-hindsight-poorly-named $$\pi$$.
For one thing, by virtue of being the _actual_ circle constant, it simplifies the formula for the
circumference of a circle:

$$
    C = \tau r
$$

Then we can compute the area of a circle by summing the areas of an infinitude of infinitesimally thin
triangular slices with height $$r$$ and combined base lengths $$C$$ to find

$$
    A = \frac{1}{2}Cr = \frac{1}{2}\tau r^2
$$

The measure of a full circle is $$\tau$$ radians; the measure of one-third of a circle is $$\frac{1}{3}\tau$$ radians.
And of course $$e^{i\tau} = 1$$.

Food for thought.

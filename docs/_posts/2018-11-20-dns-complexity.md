From Bert Hubert's blog post
["The DNS Camel"](https://blog.powerdns.com/2018/03/22/the-dns-camel-or-the-rise-in-dns-complexit/) (2018-03-22):

Bert suggests that DNS's complexity problem, and the causes of that problem, are unique to DNS.
I'd say that these problems, and causes, are at least equally applicable to C++ standardization.
I recommend reading [all of Bert's essay](https://blog.powerdns.com/2018/03/22/the-dns-camel-or-the-rise-in-dns-complexit/) â€” it's a good one.

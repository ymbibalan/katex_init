When Mixpanel's lit club did Shakespeare's _Othello_, I was reading it out of
[_A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare_](https://amzn.to/2C3Yea8), which is
full of footnotes collected from other annotated editions — incidentally including
some commentary by [Coleridge](http://theshakespeareblog.com/2015/10/samuel-taylor-coleridge-and-shakespeare/).

For my money the most consistently amusing and enlightening commentary in the book
comes from the great Shakespearean actor [Edwin Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Booth)
(1833–1893).

Act II, scene 2:

> CASSIO. Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs.—Forgive
> us our sins!—Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think,
> gentlemen, I am drunk: This is my ancient, this is my right hand,
> and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,
> and I speak well enough.

Booth explains:

> The traditional "business," said to be [Charles Kemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kemble)'s, cannot be improved upon.
> Cassio drops his handkerchief, and in his effort to recover it, falls on his knees;
> to account for this position to his companions, he attempts to pray. His clothes
> being awry, his sword has slipped to his right side, and this confuses him for
> a moment as to which is his right or his left hand. Whatever you do here, do it
> delicately and with great seriousness, and show a readiness to fight any one who
> *thinks* you're drunk. The more dignified your manner, the more absurd and yet
> correct your performance will be.

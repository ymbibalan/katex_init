I can't exactly call this "What I'm reading lately," because I haven't gotten around
to fully exploring these trees. But here are two blogs I recently discovered
with good stuff.

----

[John Glenn Taylor's "Easily Mused,"](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/)
which I stumbled across while trying to discover the source of the David Letterman catchphrase
"I've been hyp-mo-tized!" Taylor apparently didn't post for the entirety of 2016
due to life upheavals, so I can only imagine what his 2020 has been like... but
in the "Easily Mused" archives you'll find quite interesting links to late-20th-century
comedy like
[Letterman](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2011/11/lotus-of-countless-petals.html),
[Woody Allen's _Take the Money and Run_](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2019/08/woody-allens-first-real-movie-turns-50.html),
and [the Goons](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2015/08/goon-with-wind-or-how-i-stopped.html);
comics from ["Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-last-superman-story.html)
to ["Peter Porkchops"](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2014/09/tales-from-earth-c-1-bo-bunny-story-by.html);
and artists-whose-names-should-be-more-famous-you'd-think such as
[Eyvind Earle](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2011/11/lotus-of-countless-petals.html)
(_Sleeping Beauty_) and
[Heinz Edelmann](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2015/11/heinz-edelmann-before-and-after-yellow.html)
(_Yellow Submarine_). Along the way I learned the significance of the pair of names
[Holmes and Rahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmes_and_Rahe_stress_scale).

Don't miss ["How to Destroy Your Vinyl Records: A Guide for Seniors."](https://johnglenntaylor.blogspot.com/2015/11/how-to-destroy-your-vinyl-records-guide.html)

[Chris Siebenmann's "Wandering Thoughts"](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/)
has more technical content — and lots of it!
During my "Classic STL" class this past week, I name-dropped his post
["Python synergies in list addressing"](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PythonListSynergies)
(January 2006), which succinctly explains all the +1s and &minus;1s that we save —
in Python, C, C++, pretty much any modern programming language — by dealing in half-open ranges
instead of closed ranges.

As you'll see from [the blog's index](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/__Index),
"Wandering Thoughts" contains way too many posts for me to pick out any specific highlights.
They're all good, and all in nice focused microblog-esque bites — a skill I have not yet mastered.

Incidentally, I picked up the phrase "blog roundup" from some other blog a long time ago;
I want to say it was [Scott Aaronson's "Shtetl-Optimized."](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)

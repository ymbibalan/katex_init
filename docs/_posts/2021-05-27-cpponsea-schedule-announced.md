excerpt: |
  The schedule for C++ on Sea 2021 has been announced! The "conference day"
  involves two tracks of five talks each, plus a keynote by Barbara Geller
  and Ansel Sermersheim.
  The two "workshop days" offer... well, you should sign up for my own
  two-day training class, at which point the other offerings are moot.
  But, just for the record, the two available two-day classes are:

  * Arthur O'Dwyer's ["Modern STL Programming"](https://cpponsea.uk/2021/sessions/workshop_modern-stl-programming-algorithms-containers-iterators.html)

  * Anthony Williams' ["More Concurrent Thinking in C++"](https://cpponsea.uk/2021/sessions/workshop_more-concurrent-thinking-in-cpp.html)

  If you don't do a two-day class, then on Wednesday you can choose among these options:

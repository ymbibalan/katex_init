Yesterday, while our power was out due to Hurricane Isaias,
I read Peter Gilliver et al.'s [_The Ring of Words_](https://amzn.to/3iaHtNT) (2006).
Subtitled "Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary," this
is a fascinating collection of tidbits on the vocabulary of
J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium.

For example, apparently Tolkien coined the word _legendarium_,
or at least borrowed it into English from Latin and "various
other European languages." (The older English term for a collection
of legends was simply _a legendary_.)

The book starts with two longish essays on Tolkien as lexicographer
and Tolkien as wordwright; then devotes half its page count to an
alphabetical collection of words (_a glossary_) each somehow
coined, borrowed, or otherwise alchemized by Tolkien.

Tolkien got onto the staff of the OED right after World War I,
with the help of his former undergraduate tutor William Craigie.
The work of finding quotations and deducing etymologies was split
up alphabetically, and Craigie's team happened to be working on
words beginning with U at that time, so Tolkien was taken off and
reassigned to the team working on words beginning with W, because
it turns out that that's where you can really use someone who
knows the Germanic languages.

According to the OED (or at least according to _The Ring of Words_),
the word cognate with _nut_ in Latin-derived languages (_noix_, _nuez_)
tends to refer to the walnut. In Germanic tongues, the cognate word
tended to refer to the hazelnut; and so, if an ancient German wanted to talk about the
walnut specifically, they'd refer to it as "that foreign nut," using
a prefix _walh-_ indicating foreigners that in that context meant
those foreign Romans west and south of Germany. After the Anglo-Saxon
invasion of the British isles, [the same word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walhaz)
was applied to those foreigners west and south of Angle-land — that is,
the Welsh. See also: Wallonia, Wallachia, Cornwall.

You may be familiar with the notion of the [bear taboo](https://charlierussellbears.com/LinguisticArchaeology.html).
Every Northern European language's word for "bear" is not its "true name"
but merely a euphemism, designed to avoid drawing the animal's unwelcome
attention by using its true name aloud. _Björn_ simply means "the brown one"
(akin to our _bruin_); _медведь_ means "the honey-eater";
_[lācis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lācis)_ means "the trampler"; and so on.
Even in Southern Europe, where the Proto-Indo-European root form was preserved
in names like Greek _ἄρκτος_ and Latin _ursus_, it's been theorized that
the PIE root really just means something like "the destroyer," which itself
was a euphemism replacing some even older, "truer" word now lost.
(See also: the [euphemism treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism_treadmill).)

Anyway, under the entry for "bee-hunter," _The Ring of Words_ cites R.W. Chambers'
theory that the name _Beowulf_ — "bee-wolf" or "bee-foe" — is itself an epithet
meaning no more or less than "[the hero as strong as a] bear."

The word _fairy_ acquired its modern sense of "an individual inhabitant of fairyland"
quite late — "the late 14th century," says _The Ring of Words_.
The older word for one of these beings was of course _fay_ (as in Morgan le Fay).
Just as cream comes from a creamery, fays issue forth from Fay-ery, or Faërie.
At some relatively modern point, fays became fairies and so the word for Faerie
itself had to shift one place to the left and become Fairyland.
(For more on fairies, see ["A Parody on Iolanthe"](/blog/2020/07/20/a-parody-on-iolanthe) (2020-07-20).)

The spooky idea of barrow-wights wasn't original to Tolkien; there's a sudden
episode of battle with a barrow-dweller in the Icelandic _Grettis Saga_.
[William Morris's translation](https://sagadb.org/grettis_saga.en)
(c. 1900), with which Tolkien was undoubtedly familiar, even uses the exact term
"barrow-wight" (as well as other compounds such as "barrow-bider" and "barrow-dweller").

Anyway, I highly recommend _The Ring of Words_. It's a slim book that's well worth its
width on your shelf.

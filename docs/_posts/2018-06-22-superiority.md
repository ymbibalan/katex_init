From [_Superiority_ (1951)](http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html),
by Arthur C. Clarke:

> The military advisers were worried, and as usual turned to the scientists for help.
> Would it be possible to improve our existing weapons, they asked, so that our
> present advantage could be increased still further?
>
> "Frankly, gentlemen," said Norden, "I doubt it. Our existing weapons have practically
> reached finality. I don't wish to criticize my predecessor, or the excellent work
> done by the Research Staff in the last few generations, but do you realize that
> there has been no basic change in armaments for over a century? It is, I am afraid,
> the result of a tradition that has become conservative. For too long, the Research
> Staff has devoted itself to perfecting old weapons instead of developing new ones.
> It is fortunate for us that our opponents have been no wiser: we cannot assume
> that this will always be so."
>
> "What we want are _new_ weapons — weapons totally different from any that have been
> employed before. Such weapons can be made: it will take time, of course, but since
> assuming charge I have replaced some of the older scientists with young men and
> have directed research into several unexplored fields which show great promise.
> I believe, in fact, that a revolution in warfare may soon be upon us."
>
> We were skeptical. There was a bombastic tone in Norden's voice that made us
> suspicious of his claims. We did not know, then, that he never promised anything
> that he had not already almost perfected in the laboratory.

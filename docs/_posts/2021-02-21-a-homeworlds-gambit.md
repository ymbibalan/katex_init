This post is about [Binary Homeworlds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14634/homeworlds), the "space chess" game invented by
John Cooper and popularized by (among others) [Andy Looney](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Games/ILoveHomeworlds.html).
You can play Homeworlds online via email at [SuperDuperGames](http://superdupergames.org/gameinfo.html?game=homeworlds),
and, as of this year, in real time at [Homeworlds Live](https://homeworlds-live2.glitch.me/lobby).
Jonathan Baker runs [an annual tournament](https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/tournament/tmain.html),
which is happening as we speak.

In one of my tournament matches I observed an interesting opening [gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambit).
In Homeworlds, the early game is all about the economy. The players are (frequently) racing to build the first
medium ship. Jonathan Baker has described an aggressive opening tactic called the
["Instafreeze"](https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/tactics.html#instafreeze):
when Lee's homeworld contains a small piece, Ray can take the second small as well as a big ship
in that color, thus freezing Lee out of that color unless Lee trades his large ship.

The instafreeze happens during setup, and is driven entirely by Ray; Lee's role is simply reactive.
This next gambit — the one I noticed in the tournament — is set in motion by Lee, and is interactive.
But it begins similarly: Lee's homeworld contains a small piece, and Ray is going to use that to
threaten a jump-start on that color's economy.

When Lee's homeworld contains r1, Ray can (either deliberately or coincidentally)
_avoid_ red in his own homeworld. Ray's natural second move will be to swap for r1, that being
the one color he doesn't yet own. This leaves a single r1 in the stash. Ray's third move,
if Lee lets him, is to build a second r1 at home. Boom! Lee is frozen out of red —
_and_ Ray has only two reds at home, meaning he's safe to build r2 on his fourth move!

This is the happy path for Ray: Lee just completely let him do his own thing. This is obviously
_not_ the happy path for Lee. So let's see what Lee should do to throw a wrench into Ray's plans.

If Lee notices that his own homeworld contains r1, and Ray's has no red, then on turn two
Lee can trade for r1 — a color already present at his homeworld! This leaves a single r1
in the stash. <b>Gambit offered.</b>

If Ray trades for r1 (remember, this would be a perfectly natural second move), <b>gambit accepted.</b>
Lee gets to build the first r2 — but Ray gets to build r2 right afterward. We expect a flurry
of trades and builds ("trade r2 for...; build r2; trade r2 for...") as both players rapidly
develop a fleet of medium ships.

Alternatively, Ray might decide that rapid development isn't his style, and respond by
building another small in the color he's got; or by trading instead for r3, which keeps Ray in
the red economy without actually opening up the r2s for Lee. (And Lee certainly isn't
going to open them up for Ray!) <b>Gambit declined.</b> In this case, Lee has maybe lost
a little time; but he's shut off Ray's path to a quick r2, and I think it ends up
pretty even. The development continues much more "quietly" than if Lee's gambit had
been accepted.

Here are two representative game trees — one in yellow, one in red. In both cases,
player 1 (South) was the first to move. On the left: happy path for North.
In the middle: Gambit declined. On the right: Gambit accepted.

I wrote a quick-and-dirty filter to scan through my
[archive of 2755 games (2005–2018)](https://github.com/Quuxplusone/Homeworlds/tree/master/superdupergames-archive)
for cases of the following pattern:

- The first player's second move is a trade for small ship.

- The ship's color is the same as a small piece in the star.

- The second player's homeworld contains no piece of that color.

- The second player *does* have access to blue (otherwise the gambit could not be accepted).

Here are the results, enumerated and tabulated:

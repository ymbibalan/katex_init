My father recently forwarded me an article from the Folger Theatre
on [highlights from the Folger's Booth collection](https://shakespeareandbeyond.folger.edu/2019/03/05/nora-titone-shares-highlights-from-the-folgers-booth-collection/) —
"Booth" here being mainly Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, but also
actor and presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth, and their father
Junius Brutus Booth (senior).

Intrigued by a newspaper clipping reproduced in the Folger article, I tracked
down the full text of Charles Pope's article on "The Eccentric Booths" (1897-03-27)
in the Washington _Evening Star_. [It's worth a read.](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1897-03-27/ed-1/seq-21/)

Previously on this blog: Edwin Booth ("[Booth on Cassio](/blog/2019/01/05/booth-on-cassio/)," 2019-01-05);
the _Evening Star_ ("[Put the clock forward](/blog/2018/05/21/put-the-clock-forward/)," 2018-05-21).

The existence of a Junius Brutus Booth (senior) implies the existence of a (junior);
and in fact [Junius Brutus Booth Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junius_Brutus_Booth_Jr.)'s
eldest son was Junius Brutus Booth III. However, there was no Junius Brutus Booth IV, because
Junius III
[killed both himself and his wife](https://boothiebarn.com/picture-galleries/booth-family/jbb-jr/article-about-junius-brutus-booth-iiis-murder-suicide-1/)
in a December 1912 murder-suicide.

Over on the other side of page 21 of the 1897-03-27 _Evening Star_, we find an uncredited poem which feels
serendipitously relevant to my recent [Michelin star map post](/blog/2019/03/26/michelin-stars-nyc-2019/).
The poem here runs under the title "The Good Old Things," but it seems to be a slight abridgement
of a comic poem by James Courtney Challiss titled
["My Daughter's Learned to Cook,"](https://books.google.com/books?id=33cUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA53) which
runs as follows:

> We used to have old-fashioned things, like hominy and greens,  
> We used to have just common soup made out of pork and beans;  
> But now it's bouillon, consommé, and things made from a book,  
> And Pot-au-Feu and Julienne, since my daughter's learned to cook!
>
> We used to have a piece of beef — just ordinary meat —  
> And pickled pigs' feet, spare ribs, too, and other things to eat;  
> While now it's filet and ragout, and leg of mutton braised,  
> And macaroni au gratin and [sheep's head Hollandaised](https://books.google.com/books?id=-nr21hjYAn8C&pg=PA427&dq=No..258),
>
> Escallops [á là Versailles](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25877/shrimp-versailles/), á là this and á là that,  
> And [sweetbread á là Dieppoise](https://books.google.com/books?id=1HNAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA25&dq=sweetbread.a.la.dieppoise) — it's enough to kill a cat!  
> But while I suffer sweetly, I invariably look  
> As if I were delighted that my daughter's learned to cook!
>
> We have a lot of salad things, with dressing mayonnaise,  
> In place of oysters, Blue Points, fricasseed a dozen ways,  
> And orange roly-poly, float, and peach meringue, alas —  
> Enough to wreck a stomach that is made of plated brass!
>
> The good old things have passed away, in silent sad retreat;  
> We've lots of high-falutin' things, but nothing much to eat.  
> And while I never say a word, and always pleasant look,  
> You bet I've had dyspepsia since my daughter's learned to cook!

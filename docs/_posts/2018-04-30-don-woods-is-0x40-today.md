Today (April 30th) is the birthday of [Don Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)),
one of the two authors of the original _Adventure_. (And also one of the designers of [INTERCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL) (1972).
And also one of the six(?) coauthors<sup>[1](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/revision-history.html)</sup> of the 1983
[_Hacker's Dictionary_](https://amzn.to/2Vz0vmM).)

If you have never heard of _Adventure_ — or if you have heard of it, vaguely, via references to
"xyzzy" or "twisty little passages", but have never played it — then you are missing out on a great
experience in computer gaming history. You can find many, many versions of _Adventure_ online, including
[my own faithful port](http://quuxplusone.github.io/Advent/) which I will surely write more about at
some point.

For those who *have* played _Adventure_, I highly recommend Dennis Jerz's long research paper
[_Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave_](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009/000009.html) (2007).
It describes the relationship of Crowther's original game to the "meatspace" Bedquilt Cave, and also engages
in extensive [source diving](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Source_diving) to highlight some of Woods' contributions
(and vice versa, debunk some myths about the original):

> An examination of this table reveals several insights. Crowther's original version contains no vocabulary
> words to represent commands for saving a game, reporting the score, or taking inventory of possessions;
> all these elements were added by Woods. One of the most versatile objects in the Crowther/Woods collaboration,
> the bottle — which can be empty or full, and refilled with water or oil — exists in a greatly simplified form
> in the Crowther original. The word "BOTTL[E]" and the word "WATER" both have the number 1020, indicating that
> the container and its contents were treated by Crowther as the same object. There are table entries for "POUR"
> and "DRINK," both of which will set a flag that indicates the bottle is empty; yet there are no commands for
> refilling the bottle. Since the last prop in this list is 1023, the numbering suggests Crowther added the
> bottle at a late stage in the game's development.

Source divers will certainly appreciate the 1998 collaboration between Don Woods and Don Knuth that produced a
translation of _Adventure_ into a CWEB "literate program". The beautiful (and fairly informative, and fairly
entertaining) result is [here](http://literateprogramming.com/adventure.pdf), and is also included as pages
235–395 of Knuth's [_Selected Papers on Fun & Games_](https://amzn.to/2RhoZTb) (2011).

Don Woods actually lives pretty close to me in the grand scheme of things — down in South Bay — and I went
to visit him once, about five years ago, during the time I was developing [_Colossal Cave: The Board Game_](https://amzn.to/2Ryo1kA).
He is an avid board gamer — his [home page](http://www.icynic.com/~don/) lists _Race for the Galaxy_
and _Dominion_ among his favorites — and so he had some people over and we played a prototype of _CC:TBG_,
and also a game or two of _San Juan_ if I recall correctly, and generally a good time was had by all.
In other words, last I checked, he's a good programmer and a good guy.

Happy birthday, Don Woods!

Here's another [Binary Homeworlds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14634/homeworlds) puzzle.
Like ["Homeworlds Puzzle: The Prestige"](/blog/2020/06/16/homeworlds-the-prestige/) (2020-06-16),
this one was inspired by Raymond Smullyan's _[The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes](https://amzn.to/37BjnIa)_.
I actually came up with this one _before_ "The Prestige," and originally posted it to BoardGameGeek back
in early June.

For details of how I created the puzzle, and how I created the image (thanks to Sleafar on Puzzling
StackExchange!), see [the first post in this series](/blog/2020/05/29/homeworlds-mini-doomsday-machine/).

According to Looney Labs' website, the Pyramid Quartet standalone Homeworlds set goes on sale
November 12. You can [preorder it from Looney Labs!](http://store.looneylabs.com/Homeworlds)


## The puzzle

Consider the following position in a game of Binary Homeworlds (using the Pyramid Quartet rules).

![A graphical representation of the game state.](/blog/images/2020-10-28-mercury-in-retrograde.png)

    Lee (0,g2b1) y3-
    Ray (1,r3b2) g1-r1y3g3
    DS1 (g2) r2g3-r2y1
    DS2 (y2) y3b1b3-
    DS3 (b2) -r3y1y2g3
    DS4 (y2) g1b1-b3
    DS5 (b2) r1-
    DS6 (g2) r1b3-
    DS7 (g1) -r2r3y1

The stash is empty.

Lee has just moved. His move was not "pass." *What was it?*

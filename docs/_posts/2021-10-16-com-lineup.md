Next week, October 18 through 24, the Gathering 4 Gardner is hosting a week-long
Celebration of Mind, featuring three brief presentations per day, every day.
[The speaker lineup has just been announced](https://www.gathering4gardner.org/g4gs-celebration-of-mind-2021-10/) —
and with a nicer HTML layout than [last time](https://www.gathering4gardner.org/g4gs-celebration-of-mind-april-2021/),
too! The new layout makes this very short summary lineup less necessary than last time,
but heck, it's content.

All times are New York time. All presentations
are hosted at the same Zoom webinar link: [here.](https://zoom.us/j/93502013825)
